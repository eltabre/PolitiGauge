["\nAll of them -- Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler -- and their establishment media allies, Rachel Maddow, Chris Cuomo, Chuck Todd, Nicolle Wallace -- they're prepared to do anything - divide america, undermine faith in democracy and the rule of law - anything, if it helps take down President Trump, the insurgent populist they despise. They are a modern aristocracy. They think they are born to rule. They consider it the most appalling impertinence that the American people kicked them out in 2016 and installed an outsider in the Oval Office. They see it as a peasant's revolt, and they've been trying to overturn it ever since.\nThat's what this is about, all of it -- whether it is demands for more information, or more testimony, or the underlying evidence for impeachment or whatever the hell is the latest thing is. It's all about one thing really - the establishment's fury at the populist revolution and their implacable determination to crush it.\nAdapted from Steve Hilton's monologue from \"The Next Revolution\" on April 21, 2019.", "\nHouse Democrats issue subpoena for the full Mueller report; reaction and analysis from South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman, Republican member of the House Oversight Committee.\nAs President Trump searches for the right responses to the Mueller report, he would be wise to follow the idea that \u201crevenge is a dish best served cold.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s temptation will be to nurse grudges and settle scores immediately. A self-made man who became president his way, he will want to unleash his greatest ever punchback against those who put him through two years of hell.\nWho can blame him? No modern president has endured such fanatical hatred from his opponents, a group that extends far beyond the opposition party to include the gullible people who still believe everything they read in The New York Times and see on CNN.\nIt has to be extra aggravating that much of the contents and language of the report confirms Trump\u2019s claim that his inquisitors were a cabal of \u201cangry Democrats.\u201d The circular quality of the report is astonishing: Anonymous leaks, many clearly from the FBI and intelligence agencies, are the basis of stories in the Times and The Washington Post, which are then cited by Mueller as authoritative reports either deserving of investigation or proving a point.", "\nHillary Clinton: There's not enough time to make her a better candidate\nThere have generally been two reactions to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Dec. 3 statement at Georgetown University that America should try to \u201cempathize\u201d with our nation\u2019s \u201cenemies.\u201d\nOne camp holds that Mrs. Clinton simply chose the wrong word to express a banal thought\u2014that the U.S. must understand its enemies. The other camp says her State Department record demonstrates she herself lacks the empathy to know how to deal with America\u2019s adversaries or allies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nBoth responses are true, yet I have another observation about her speech: It is further evidence Mrs. Clinton is at best a mediocre presidential candidate. She was lackluster in 2008 and worse today. The stiff, off-putting style is familiar. What\u2019s more surprising is how sloppy, ill-prepared and tone-deaf she has become.", "\nWhite conservatives are always on defense against charges of hating President Obama because he is black; suppressing minority voters and indifference to the difficulty minorities have living everyday with the legacy of slavery and a culture filled with stereotypes of black inferiority.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis week white conservatives can take a break, step out of the dock and make way for white liberals.\nI know from personal experience at National Public Radio that white liberals can be very intolerant if they suspect they are dealing with a black person who is not afraid from depart from liberal orthodoxy.\nHacked emails from Hollywood\u2019s white, liberal elite show them belittling the president by assuming his taste in movies is confined to racial stereotypes fitting just another black guy.\nPascal is one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful people and certainly at the top of the movie industry\u2019s list of most influential women. She must have a penetrating intellect and tremendous business savvy.\nSo how is it possible for her to think that a 53-year-old, Harvard trained constitutional lawyer who is now president of the United States, is to be solely defined by his race?\nShe assumes that he is sure to share the working-class, juvenile delight of Hart\u2019s racial slapstick. And it does not make much sense in her racial construct but she also thinks the president must also be interested in movies about the weighty topics of slavery and the civil rights movement.\nPascal and Rudin, on their way to meet the president at a Democratic fundraiser, have no hesitation about painting Obama into this limited, one-dimensional personality. What they have revealed is how demeaning and patronizing their liberal minds can be even when the man is the leader of the nation.\nChris Rock, the comedian and actor, recently said Hollywood is a \u201cwhite industry\u2026 it just is.\u201d He added they don\u2019t hire black men.\nI imagine they do hire some black people. But those black people have to color inside the lines of what white liberals think is the right kind of black person. Black conservatives have no chance in that world.\nBlack intellectuals and even black left wingers have no chance either. But that is a different story. In the restrictive confines of the white liberal world they would be seen as threatening black people.\nPascal and Rudin have both apologized for the content of their private emails. \u201cThe content of my e-mails to Scott were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am. Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.\u201d\nRudin gave a statement to Deadline.com, explaining that his emails were \"written in haste and without much thought or sensitivity,\" he understood the notes were out of line. \"I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive,\" he said.\nI know from personal experience at National Public Radio that white liberals can be very intolerant if they suspect they are dealing with a black person who is not afraid from depart from liberal orthodoxy. In my case I was fired and afterwards described as a bigot in need of a psychiatric care.\nIn Pascal\u2019s moment of crisis she is, even today, sticking to the game of racial boxes by taking calls from Al Sharpton as if he is the president of black America. Sharpton will no doubt end up with a contract in exchange for not staging phony demonstrations or challenging Sony on their lack of honesty about race.\nMalcolm X, during his Nation of Islam radicalism, once said white conservatives are not friends to black people but \u201cat least don\u2019t try to hide it.\u201d The separatist minded Malcolm X had even harsher words for white liberals. He judged them to be \u201cmore hypocritical than the conservative.\u201d He accused white liberals of \u201cperfecting the art of posing as the Negro\u2019s friend and benefactor\u201d while using black people as a \u201cpawn or tool\u201d in their political fight with white conservatives.\nOne word of caution is due as conservatives enjoy this moment of white liberal hypocrisy.\nThese emails were obtained as the result of a malicious act of cyber-criminality. The conversation was a private exchange and protected under all laws governing private communications.\nThe paltry benefit of skewering Sony executives should not obscure the danger of criminals gaining access to every e-mail you and I have sent or received and then posting it in the public domain for the entire nation to read. Confidential health information on Sony employees was also disclosed. Would you want all of your private, unfiltered communications with friends, family and co-workers plastered all over the web for people to make judgments about you?\nSo while the contents of the emails are a dazzling display of white liberal hypocrisy it should not distract anyone from the need for the nation to condemn this intrusion as criminal, unacceptable behavior and punished to the fullest extent of the law. Congress needs to move cyber-security to the top of their agenda next year.\nBut for the moment, let\u2019s take a long look at white liberals revealing themselves so nakedly, condescending to even the president of the United States because he\u2019s black.\nJuan Williams is a co-host of FNC's \"The Five,\" where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.

He appears to be a wonderful husband and father; he lives comfortably with his mother-in-law, which speaks volumes about his temperament. His personal life seems above reproach and vice-free; his fondness for cigarettes is humanizing and thus sort of winning.\nThat said, Mr. Obama must go. He is absolutely the wrong man to occupy the White House at this time. He aspires to grandiosity, but we cannot afford grandiosity. He yearns to even the scales but we need to balance the scales. He pushes to redistribute our income, but we need to produce more income. He lectures while we need inspiration.\nRepublican candidates hoping to unseat Mr. Obama in 2012 stepped out in Iowa last week, raising their hands and heads for attention. They come in various shapes and sizes; they have less or more experience, and brighter or duller credentials.\nHere\u2019s what they have in common: any one of them would likely do a better job than the current occupant of the White House. Any one of them could more intelligently create jobs, bolster the confidence of our small business owners, articulate the common sense needs and fears of the nation\u2019s majority and stand tall for the values that shaped this nation.\nI\u2019m not talking about gay marriage, or abortion rights or any of the \u201csocial issues\u201d that Mitch Daniels wisely advised tabling in this election cycle. I\u2019m talking about the ability to aspire and to prosper, to work hard and invest for your children\u2019s future, to create a better world for those who will come next. Only if most Americans succeed will we care for those in need. Only if we continue to offer the world a culture that celebrates achievement will those with ambition and resources continue to clamber for admission.\nHere\u2019s my candidate in 2012: anyone but Obama. The president is damaging the country, growing the apparatus of government like a frenzied gardener over-fertilizing honeysuckle. Once in place, the committees and panels and agencies and czars become entrenched \u2013 almost impossible to remove. Four more years could make permanent the rents in our nation\u2019s fabric.\nAmericans elected Mr. Obama in hopes that he would narrow our differences and help to heal a divided people. He has instead driven us apart, lashing out at one group after another as he pushes for political advantage. Americans are angry and alarmed; this is no time to pit one group against another.\nAt a time when our country desperately needs to out-gun our rivals in the global marketplace, the White House ensnares our industries with cumbersome and costly regulations.\nWhen we need a pragmatic reordering of our spending, Mr. Obama embraces follies: billion-dollar high speed trains to nowhere and windmills that will drive up our energy costs.\nAs we confront an ever more uncertain Middle East, the White House dithers over domestic energy supplies.\nAt a moment when our entitlements programs threaten our fiscal future, President Obama insists on expanding our safety net. As the entire nation worries about sky-rocketing healthcare costs, the president guarantees the upward trajectory by funneling 30 million more patients into our groaning hospitals and waiting rooms.\nPrimary season approaches, and GOP contenders will be battling it out for the chance to run against Mr. Obama in 2012. The candidates will adopt positions that curry favor with one interest group or another, and will inevitably lose support along the campaign trail. They will be bruised by the process. The liberal media will be on the attack, challenging their humanity and casting doubt on their intelligence or their religion. They will belittle their abilities and backgrounds, casting success as something Americans should shun.\nDon\u2019t be fooled. Every one of the candidates vying for the nomination has stronger credentials than 2008 candidate Obama. More important, each has a profound belief in the unique blessing that is our land of opportunity. Each understands the great promise of our democracy, and also its limitations.\nThis is a pivotal moment in our country\u2019s future. We cannot afford four more years of President Obama.", "\nWhile the famed green archer risked his life in defense of the natural right to retain private property (from thieves like the cruel sheriff of Nottingham and King John who stripped peasants of their land and livelihood), in this interview Senator Obama questions to what extent this right even exists.\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it. Listen to it. Did you hear what I heard?\nThere can be no longer any doubt. Senator Obama\u2019s enduring political philosophy is socialist at the core. And his leanings, in this regard, are radical; he would like to see all three branches of the federal government play a role in restructuring our society according to \u201credistributive\u201d economic principles.\nAs I listen to the interview, I must say it is hard to believe our leading United States presidential candidate said, just seven years ago, that it is a tragedy the civil rights movement failed to get the Supreme Court to venture into the issues of redistribution of wealth. It is hard to believe the leading United States presidential candidate said, just seven years ago, \u201cany three of us sitting here could come up with a rationale for bringing economic change through the courts.\u201d It is hard to believe the leading United States presidential candidate suggested, just seven years ago, we should be seeking legislative and administrative avenues to effect \u201credistributive change,\u201d since it is impractical now to get the courts to do it on their own. It\u2019s even harder to believe the leading United States presidential candidate, just seven years ago, was talking about the importance of community organizers \u201cputting together the actual coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributive change.\u201d\nBut then again, maybe I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Seven years later, and just one month before Election Day, Senator Obama said to Joe the Plumber, word for word, \u201cI think when you spread the wealth around, it\u2019s good for everyone.\u201d\nI don\u2019t doubt Senator Obama\u2019s good will. In fact, he is right about many things.\nThe great divide between the rich and the poor in our times is scandalous and reprehensible. And the blessings of this earth were destined by God for the common good of all his creatures.\nBut we know from history, from very sad periods of history, there is no real justice\u2014no progress and no lasting peace\u2014when its pursuit involves beating down some to lift up others. And we also know, by the dictates of reason and the practice of all ages, that when the government decides it can suspend the natural right to private property, through repossession or redistribution, or whatever they choose to call it, that government is on the wrong side of truth.\nJust ask Robin Hood.\nGod bless,\nFather Jonathan\nFather Jonathan Morris is author of the new book, \u201cThe Promise: God\u2019s Purpose and Plan for when Life Hurts.

He is a religious order priest, not a diocesan priest, and has never worked in a parish. This sort of ridiculous allegation has no place in this forum.\nFor those who believe Obama is merely seeking a progressive tax plan, you are being deceived through either filtered information or self deception. Obama\u2019s plan is not merely progressive, meaning a higher rate for higher earners, he is proposing giving money back to those who pay little or no taxes. The latter part is what concerns most of us capitalists.\nFr. John, thank you for your wisdom. I appreciate the distinction between the heroic deeds of Robin Hood and the policies of the one who might be President. The many disingenuous argments and ad hominem attacks viewed on this sight exemplify how the lack of civility and respect in our society is the root of discord in public debate.\nThe American people who have experienced a wonderful land of opportunity and have worked hard to elevate the standards by which our constitution was framed, can only bow our heads in shame as we see those who are trying to change our whole nation to spread the wealth to those who haven\u2019t made the top rung, either because of ignorance, lack of education, or laziness and failure to meet life\u2019s challenges, are horrified at the thought of our nation becoming one without solid standards of integrity, hard work, and accomplishment. Why work, if the government will do it for me?Our backbone seems to have become jelly!\nSo Barack Obama wants to roll back taxes to what they were under the days of that Commie Socialist Ronald Reagan and now all of a sudden he\u2019s destroying the American way of life. News Flash: John McCain supported the exact same tax plan 8 years ago when he was running agains Dubya! Straight from the horse\u2019s mouth:\nDuring the 2000 campaign, on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball,\u201d a young woman asked McCain why her father, a doctor, should be \u201cpenalized\u201d by being \u201cin a huge tax bracket.\u201d McCain replied that \u201cwealthy people can afford more\u201d and that \u201cthe very wealthy, because they can afford tax lawyers and all kinds of loopholes, really don\u2019t pay nearly as much as you think they do.\u201d The exchange continued:\nYOUNG WOMAN: Are we getting closer and closer to, like, socialism and stuff?. . .\nMCCAIN: Here\u2019s what I really believe: That when you reach a certain level of comfort, there\u2019s nothing wrong with paying somewhat more.\nThe Contract with America was NOT a contract directed to all americans, just those few. Their plan was to spend the government into bankrupcty, that way, their croonies and the foxheads could have free reign to do whatever they desired. Imagine, and they are clever. No checks nor balances for them but for the rest of us\u2026No social security which i have paid for many years working for a bunch of lazy order giving slackers. Nowadays it does not matter what color or creed you are! They are so greedy they would do their own folk\u2026Totally disgusting, but the God who sits High and looks low on his people has taken control and there is no way in hell the demons will prevail. Someone has really stirred up the demons in you, American People as ya\u2019ll like to say.\nI have known Fr. Jonathan personally my whole life. I can GUARANTEE that the disgusting comments about abuse that are being posted are completely false. Anyone else who knows him personally will attest to this as well.\nYour cowardly attempt to discredit Fr. Jonathan and do further damage to the Church is not appreciated in this forum.\nLOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM AND OBAMA COMMENT AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF !\nKarl Marx posited that socialism would be achieved via class struggle and a proletarian revolution which represents the transitional stage between capitalism and communism.[3][4]\nSocialists mainly share the belief that capitalism unfairly concentrates power and wealth among a small segment of society that controls capital and creates an unequal society. All socialists advocate the creation of an egalitarian society, in which wealth and power are distributed more evenly, although there is considerable disagreement among socialists over how, and to what extent this could be achieved.[1]\nDear Fox,\nI personally like to spread my own wealth. I don\u2019t have much but I did work to start a Homeless shelter for women and their babies called Hannah\u2019s House that has been open for 16 years now. The reason why I am against Government redistributing the wealth is that I don\u2019t trust how they do it, or the fact that they require no change in behavior.\nI do not trust the way Obama wants to redistribute wealth. Besides, what he is mandating is not Charity. It is theft.FLifeforce@aol.com\nCall it what you like, but progressive taxation has been around this country for decades. And by the way, since only taxable income above $250,000 is taxed at the higher marginal rate (a rate that will be the same as the rate under Bill Clinton), the average tax rate is impacted only slightly. You remember Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, you know, when the DOW was above 10,000. Now that is what I call spreading the wealth.\nFather Morris: Thank you for your splendid article that presents in clear terms what Obama has said and what he intends. He said it in this radio interview in 2001; he said it in his response to a Supreme Court question during the last debate; and he said it in front of a camera to Joe the Plumber. He means it. It is his mindset. It\u2019s where his heart is. He believes it is right and needs to be done. And he does not mean this is taxation. He means what he says \u2014 it is redistribution of wealth. That is socialism. And that is not America\u2019s way.\nI hope decent people who are on this forum to make serious and thoughtful comments, will carefully read your article. My brother is an editorial page editor and he wrote a column today, too, on this 2001 radio interview and its implications. It is critical that people understand what Senator Barack Obama thinks about the U.S. Constitution, what he believes is the role of the Supreme Court, and how he envisions the future of the United States of America. If elected, he may well take us down so distant a road, we may never be able to return.\nThe \u201cshare the wealth\u201d program you refer to is the one already in existence in the tax code. I guess you are more comfortable talking to FoxHeads\u2026there is a 3% difference suggested by Obama\u2026so what you are saying is that 3% more is the tipping point for socialism. I don\u2019t mind your holding a contrarian view the problem is that the view you hold is based on a lie therefore\u2026your conclusion cannot be anything but a lie or at best very poor fact gathering and ignorance.\nDear Father Jonathan, it is always advisable not to try to critique that which you do not understand. Clearly, your mangled interpretation of the interview speaks volumes of your lack of logic and intellectual rigor. You are dead wrong in your analysis. Obama is not only no socialist, he is no Robin Hood either. He is simply suggesting that we should have fairness in our tax structure. When McCain wants to further reduce taxes for the wealthy, while simultaneously sending us further trillions of dollars into debt, it is laughable that you signal out Obama for criticism. McCain is far worse than Obama and far more dangerous to the long-term health of the US economy.\nCall the progressive tax system, and Obama\u2019s views in general, a desire for the redistribution of well if you will.\nBut don\u2019t close your eyes to the fact that top executives make unseemly salaries at the expense of their workers. CEO pay was 25 * the average worker in 1965. Today it\u2019s 200+ times! Now that is a real redistribution of wealth.\nAs an independent who voted Rerublican in the last four Presidential elections, I am voting for Obama. The Republican Party and their surrogates at Fox News have lost their way.\nNot only do you see but one side of the argument, you castigate anyone who might see another angle.\nThe Republican Party and Fox news are doomed to disappear if they don\u2019t begin to come to grips with the fact that they are the party of exclusion, the party of the rich. I suspect that on November 5, you will wake up outraged at the results of this election\u2026only nobody will be listening.\n\u201cit is hard to believe our leading United States presidential candidate said, just seven years ago, that it is a tragedy the civil rights movement failed to get the Supreme Court to venture into the issues of redistribution of wealth.\u201d\n-Father Jon\nI have to admit to some pretty similar stupid liberal ideas WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN!!\u2026 I almost voted for Clinton until my dad finally took the time to slam me into a chair and for the first time explain the world to me.\nBoy was he right.\nNow? Obama kids are bribing their grandparents with future visits for their vote. Disgusting, and they use that as a news story that the obamacasters laugh at as \u201ccute\u201d??\nBTW, guess what guys. Obama thinks the state should get about half of your inheritance. THEYRE MESSING WITH YOUR FAMILY HERITAGE LIKE YOUR FAMILY DOESNT MATTER.\nThe media is dead and morailty\u2026 thank God the church is pushing for their right to a political voice!\nKids? Rebel on. I did. But when youre old and you realize you had some tiny part in putting a good man like Reagan in office? It will dwarf every idiotic rebellion you\u2019ve ever contrived.\nthe Obama tax plan simplified for fixnews watchers\u2026.\nThe tax rate will be restored to Clinton era levels, remember, when the economy was the best it has ever been, business growth was unprecedented and the middle class received fair raises and had some extra money\u2026\u2026The Bush years catered to the rich and look what happened\u2026..any of that wealth trickle down to you ? NO\nSpeaking of the company you keep\u2026\u2026..When John McCain says \u201cmy friends\u201d does he mean\u2026?\nMatthew 19:23-24. Then Jesus said to his disciples, \u201cI tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d\nbut then that was before they incorporated Giant Needle Manufacturing Inc\nHistory indeed. History has proven that when the super-rich take over and tramp on everyone THAT is not sustainable.\nSomeone had a concept called \u201cTaxes\u201d - recognized as inevitable as death itself. It says that \u201cSOMEBODY has to pay the bill, its only a question of whom\u201d.\nSo Obama has suggested that the Bush favoritism of the rich be undone a bit.\nEither everybody here is stupid or rich. Can\u2019t you see that every tax dollar we give back to the rich and super rich is a dollar we working stiffs have to pay \u2026 EXTRA!\nIt\u2019s not a matter of saying there cannot be rich and super rich. It\u2019s a matter of keeping fair so we avoid a revolution.\nI think Obama talked about changing their current 35% ceiling to 38 or 39%, then lowering it.\nThe only alternatives to taxes are either no spending (absurd of course) or we just borrow everything (print money) and it\u2019ll work itself out in the form of inflation. Haha. Seriously; Taxes are here to stay. Why should the middle class take an ever-increasing share of the burden? Why is that very same middle class finding it so objectionable when Obama suggests that\u2019s not right?\nFather,\n\u201cIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d\nSo why are you not supporting Obama to redistribute wealth so that more of us will enter heaven. Is that not your job!!!!!\nFather Jonathan should consider reading his Bible some time. I would recommend the Book of Acts, in which the disciples institute a social order which can only be described as one of tyrannical communism, in which all Christians are to sell all their possessions and contribute the proceeds to the disciples. A husband and wife who sold their home but lied and only gave a portion of the proceeds to the disciples mysteriously \u201cgive up the ghost\u201d.\nThe Catholic religion itself is a socialist regime, collecting tribute from its parishioners and using it to help the poor \u2014 and build ornate cathedrals, and buy fancy gold-trimmed clothing for the clergy, but that\u2019s another topic. Father Jonathan\u2019s railing against the alleged socialism of Barack Obama, in addition to being ignorant of the meaning of the word, is also grossly hypocritical.\nFather,\nAre you serious? Jesus was a radical socialist liberal. Does \u201cA camel has a better chance of passing through the eye of needle than a rich man has of getting into heaven mean anything.\u201d You can\u2019t possibly be catholic, or you would know that the catholic church condmens socialism only in the snese of communism in which there is no God. The church has extremely liberal economic teachings that are in line with Obama\u2019s. A true man of the cloth would rise above such petty attacks and focus on issues that Obama\u2019s policies are not in line with the Church, like in terms of aborition. And since Robin Hood was an imaginary figure, your entire article has no real base. Its like comparing Harry Potter to Wiccans. Jesus teaches that it is the duty of the wealthy to help the poor and destitute. Raising taxes to the level of the Clinton years IS NOT SOCIALISM. For those of you who don\u2019t know, Socialism is total government control of the economy, which is not even close to what Obama is proposing. As a Catholic, I am shocked and offened by your ignorance.\nAgree. Sometimes I am bewildered how JC got hijacked by capitalist religion of greed. When I read new testament I am inspired by his words and then I see Reps and Cons with their hateful and greedy ways claiming him\u2026 I have to ask myself then \u2013 am I hallucinating - what kind of Orwellian place do I live in?\nCant wait for Nov 4 when Obama will win by the biggest electoral margin in history\u2026\u2026and all the fixnews clowns and followers will be whining their eyes out.\nthe Obama tax plan simplified for fixnews watchers\u2026.\nThe tax rate will be restored to Clinton era levels, remember, when the economy was the best it has ever been, business growth was unprecedented and the middle class received fair raises and had some extra money\u2026\u2026The Bush years catered to the rich and look what happened\u2026..any of that wealth trickle down to you ?

They wil not be fooled again.\nBut think of it this way. when Obama wins and the Democrats have bullet proof majorities you can blame yourselves for blowing it\u2026but you\u2019ll have 4 more years to post you drivel\u2026\u2026.if JC comes back you\u2019all better duck.\n\u201cThere used to be a time where people would say \u2018I may disagree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it.\u2019 What has happened, folks? The nobility and grace in that comment has totally gone at the window; this forum more resembles a gladitorial ring. Can\u2019t we all agree to disagree, and still be civil and kind to one another??\u201d\nI, a liberal should respect the followers of that fat bag Limbaugh? Not a chance - I do not show respect for Reps and Cons.\nFr Jonathan, what do you call it when the government takes what belongs to me and gives it to corporations? Personally, I call it fascism, but perhaps you have some additional insight you\u2019d like to share. Obama wants to stop this and you call it socialism. If that\u2019s the case than so be it. Back in the 70\u2019s at the Catholic University of America, they taught us that Christ was the world\u2019s first socialist. Of course, back in those days helping your brother wasn\u2019t considered a sin. Apparently now it is.\nPeople like me have been taking a \u201cbeat down\u201d for years now, but that doesn\u2019t seem to bother you. Why is that? Why do you defend those who would use us, steal from us, and then ship our jobs overseas? Perhaps if you had to actually earn a living instead of living off the donations of others, you would feel differently about our present economic situation. I\u2019ve always said that asking a priest about marriage is like asking a golden retriever about quantum mechanics. I guess the same rule applies to economics as well.\nActually, Obama said he did NOT think all three branches should be used in restructuring government, and in fact, that he thought attempting to make attempt to restructure the economic system through the judicial system (which, last time I checked, was one of the three branches of government) was a bad idea.\nSo the answer to your question is: No. I didn\u2019t hear what you heard. But then, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible we were listening to the same thing, since Obama\u2019s words in the comments I heard directly contradict your statements here. Maybe you were listening to your own preconceived notions about Obama, rather than to the words he was actually speaking.\nEveryone, please stop and look at yourself for just a minute!!! Throwing insults, saying \u2018I\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong!\u2019 and having a total lack of respect all the way around is just going to foster more of the same.\nThis is shameful and very sad.\nThere used to be a time where people would say \u2018I may disagree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it.\u2019 What has happened, folks? The nobility and grace in that comment has totally gone at the window; this forum more resembles a gladitorial ring. Can\u2019t we all agree to disagree, and still be civil and kind to one another?\nOr is that too much to hope for?\nTo Joe\n\u201cI believe most of the wealthy in this country donate very high amounts of money to the poor as it is. Warren Buffet and Bill Gates \u2026\u201d\nYou are an ignorant Con boy \u2013 Warren Buffet said that it is a national scandal that he pays less in taxes ( percentage-wise he pays 15% on capital gains) than his secretary or the woman who empties his wastebasket\nPolls show Obama with clear lead in Virginia\nTHE POLL: Virginia Commonwealth University, presidential race in Virginia among likely voters (13 electoral votes).\nTHE NUMBERS: Barack Obama 51 percent, John McCain 40 percent.\nOF INTEREST: Obama\u2019s strongest regions are northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, the latter dominated by military interests where McCain, a former Navy pilot, should be strong. Obama dominated among respondents who regarded the economy and health care as the most important issues. McCain was strong among people whose foremost concern was terrorism.\nTHE DETAILS: Conducted by telephone Oct. 20-22 by VCU\u2019s Center for Public Policy of 817 likely voters. The margin of sampling error plus or minus 4 percentage points.\nOF INTEREST: A month ago, the same poll showed that 52 percent felt McCain was best suited to handle the campaign against terrorism, 10 points better than Obama. Now, the poll shows that Obama has drawn almost even with McCain on the terrorism issue.\nI believe most of the wealthy in this country donate very high amounts of money to the poor as it is. Warren Buffet and Bill Gates for example give very large portions of there money to helping the needy. This is how the country should run rather than government telling us where OUR money shuold go. If i give my money to a begger on the street atleast i know who has it. But when it\u2019s taxed who knows what corrupt government official might use that money for there own gains.\nRobin Hood was supporting the right to private property? The vast majority (about 75%) of the poor in 12th century England didn\u2019t own any property. They weren\u2019t even free. The good Father is apparently an ignoramus.\nMr. Cavuto has costed Obama\u2019s policies and says the figures don\u2019t add up,but he did not say he has costed McCain\u2019s policies.In the name of \u201cfair and balanced\u201d I think he should.Personally,I don\u2019t believe either of the candidates can dig America out of the hole Republicans have dug for America (and the rest of the world),without running up the deficit further but why should that upset GOP supporters?You have been running the country in deficit since Bush was elected. It seems to me that Americans,at least until recently, cannot accept economic realities.No-one wants to hear that things aren\u2019t going to get better overnight,that most are going to do it tough ,probably for years,no matter who gets in!!Obama\u2019s policies should keep the pain to a minimum for the maximum of Americans.McCain\u2019s policies seems to think the stock market is more important than working-class peoples\u2019 well being.Its not surprising.Those villified Wall Street types that McCain has been blaming for economic melt down\u2013I wonder how they vote?Does anyone doubt that Wall Street votes Republican?\nPalin drags down McCain, though GOP base loves her\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Sarah Palin has become a drag on the Republican presidential ticket, the first time in recent political history that a running mate has made such a difference.\nAmong many independents and moderate Republicans, she\u2019s raised serious questions about John McCain\u2019s judgment, become too much of a national punch line and reinforced concerns about McCain\u2019s age.\n\u201cNice lady, no experience. It\u2019s so sad. She\u2019s a gigantic drag,\u201d said Chris DePino , a Republican consultant based in New Haven, Conn.\nThe Alaska governor does help the ticket somewhat by energizing hard-core Republicans, but polls suggest that overall \u201cshe\u2019s hurting John McCain ,\u201d said Andrew Kohut , the president of the Pew Research Center .\nIn a nationwide survey Oct. 16-19 , Pew found that 49 percent of respondents had unfavorable views of Palin, while 44 percent saw her favorably. A month earlier, 54 percent had seen her favorably and 32 percent viewed her negatively.\nTypically, post-election polls find that vice-presidential choices sway about 1 percent of voters. This time, Kohut said, \u201cwe\u2019ll get a much bigger number.\u201d\nA key reason is that \u201cthe Palin choice reflects poorly on Senator McCain\u2019s judgment,\u201d said vice presidential expert Joel Goldstein , a professor of law at St. Louis University .\nPew found that 41 percent of respondents thought McCain showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d overall, while 29 percent said that of Democratic nominee Barack Obama . While McCain\u2019s number isn\u2019t solely because of his choice of Palin, her selection was a factor.\nMcCain\u2019s age is also a reason for voters\u2019 concern about Palin. The Arizona senator is 72 and has had four instances of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. Mayo Clinic physicians have posted a detailed explanation of McCain\u2019s condition and treatment on his Web site. The prognosis, they said, was \u201cgood.\u201d\nWorries linger, however.\n\u201cIf something happened to McCain, she would not be qualified to step in and be president,\u201d said Annette Barron , an independent voter from Altamonte Springs, Fla.\nPalin also has hurt herself by becoming largely invisible to the general public, except when she got media attention for starting controversies \u2014 such as charging that Obama was \u201cpalling around with terrorists\u201d \u2014 or for receiving $150,000 in clothing and accessories from the Republican Party .\nShe also unabashedly identifies herself with the party\u2019s conservative wing, alienating moderates.\n\u201cIt reinforced the notion that John McCain cared little about people like me,\u201d said former Maine state Rep. Sherry Huber , a Republican who backed McCain in the primary but now supports Obama. \u201cShe clearly does not share the values I and other moderate Republicans do.\u201d\nObama knows as little about Robin Hood as he does about everything else. I\u2019m sure that he has probably never heard about Robin Hood since he would probably have been more in tune with Kenyan fairy tales. Stealing from one group to hand out to another is never right, furthermore it never works out as planned. Most people who work for a living would consider the government confiscating their earnings as an organized criminal enterprise comprised of a den of thieves. If Obama were to be elected, the best action would be to quit work and stay at home. Let the government scrounge for money elsewhere. Maybe the U.N. will provide the funds for the Dems grand schemes. An entirely unemployed nation will be a challenge to feed, especially for this particular messiah.\nA surprising number of commenters on this forum have suggested with foaming rancor that Catholics who support Obama \u201cwill burn in Hell\u201d or \u201care not true Catholics.\u201d I make no claim to be a true anything, nor can I can claim to deserve anything, and in this way, with nothing and no excuse for myself before those who also have no excuse, I want to say this to the people who are saying these things.\nPlease, please, do not speak this way. If this is how we are\u2013if this is where this October has brought us\u2013then everything is already lost. Then there is no community, and we are in hell already. This feels far away from God. When we have come to this point it is far less important what vote you cast than the spirit in which you cast it. Please pray on what you are thinking before you write it.\nYou are exactly right. The key point is \u201creturning what is rightfully theirs\u201d. Obama seems more than happy to take what belongs to me and give it to someone else. I thought I had the moral obligation to give what I can to someone who needs it, but that moral obligation does not extend to allow what is mine to be taken from me for the benefit of some unknown.\nPlease pray for our country..things are looking grim and only God can help us now.\nI say, let\u2019s take Obama at his word that he will not raise - and may lower - taxes on those who make under $250,000. He has said that often enough that anyone who still brings up $42,000 or some other number is a liar. Now, Wikipedia (Personal Income in the United States) reports, from Census Bureau figures, that people in the U.S. making $100,000 and up in 2006 were 5.63% of the workforce, so those making $250,000 and up could well be under 5% (of the workforce). Thus, if Obama only increases taxes on those making $250,000 or more, 95%, at least, of the workforce will be unaffected.\nAs to the Robin Hood story, Father Jonathan is full of it. When he says, \u201cRobin Hood is a legitimate hero, not because he robbed from the rich and gave to the poor, but rather because he returned to the poor what lawfully belonged to them.\u201d Most of those Robun Hood robbed in the forest were men who only incidentally made money off the poor. It was the king who really robbed the poor. Actually, Robin Hood WAS involved with redistributing the wealth.\nAnd, just why should anyone making under $250,000 a year be upset by this. Are McCain\u2019s audiences made up only of those earning over $250,00 per year?\nOn closer inspection, the \u201cbombshell audio\u201d turns out to be a rather wonkish, somewhat impenetrable, discussion of the Supreme Court under Earl Warren. Obama, then a University of Chicago law professor and Illinois state senator, argued that the courts have traditionally been reluctant to get involved in income distribution questions. He suggested that the civil rights movement had made a mistake in expecting too much from the courts \u2014 and that such issues were better decided by the legislative branch of government.\nYou can read the entire transcript of the interview here, courtesy of Fox News, but here is the passage in which Obama explains that courts are \u201cnot very good\u201d at redistributing wealth:\nMaybe I am showing my bias here as a legislator as well as a law professor, but you know I am not optimistic about bringing about major redistributive change through the courts. You know the institution just isn\u2019t structured that way\u2026. Any of the three of us sitting here could come up with a rationale for bringing about economic change through the courts. I think that, as a practical matter, that our institutions are just poorly equipped to do it.\nIn other words, Obama says pretty much the opposite of what the McCain camp says he said. Contrary to the spin put on his remarks by McCain economics adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin, he does not express \u201cregret\u201d that the Supreme Court has not been more \u201cradical.\u201d Nor does he describe the Court\u2019s refusal to take up economic redistribution questions as a \u201ctragedy.\u201d He uses the word \u201ctragedy\u201d to refer not to the Supreme Court, but to the civil rights movement:\nOne of the tragedies of the civil rights movement was that the civil rights movement became so court focused, I think, there was a tendency to lose track of the political and organizing activities on the ground that are able to bring about the coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributive change.\nHoltz-Eakin \u201cread a different interview to the one I heard,\u201d said Dennis Hutchinson, a University of Chicago law professor who joined Obama in the panel discussion. \u201cObama said that redistribution of wealth issues need to be decided by legislatures, not by the courts. That is what a progressive income tax is all about.\u201d\nWhile there are sharp differences between the two candidates on economic issues, they both favor a progressive income tax system in which people with high incomes are taxed at a higher rate than people with low incomes.\nFather, we are talking about adjusments to a tax policy that has - for a LONG time - been based on the accepted practice of tiered tax brackets. The adjustment starts with rolling back George Bush tax cuts that refuse to accept the we have no way to pay for the wars we are currently engaged in.\nAnd as far as distribution of wealth, let me tell you about how it works in Corporate America, where I have worked for over 20 years. If you are a regular employee and your company does well, you get a small bonus. If it does not, you may be laid off with 2 weeks severance - if you are luckly. If you are in upper management, you get hundreds of thousands - or millions in bonus if the company does well. And if it doesn\u2019t, well you get rid of the lower employees and limit yourself to maybe half your usual bonus. To the executives, the lord giveth\u2026 and he giveth some more.\nHow do you think we have a greater disparity of wealth between the richest and the poorest than ever before?\nthis is where the skin heads find their recruits\u2026\u2026only the intelligence level is not always up to their standards\u2026.so there might be a need for a re-education camp\u2026.I also hear the Junta in Burma is looking for a few right wing nut jobs to man the baracades\u2026..send you resumes along.\nthere is also talk about bring back the Inquisition\u2026think some of you migth fit the required profile\u2026.no brain required just need to hate\u2026.anyone you choose just can\u2019t be white folks.\nFr. Jonathan: You are so right, correct I mean. I prefer giving to charities of my choice and they are numerous plus over my lifetime I\u2019ve paid taxes at a pretty good level that have gone to social programs that help the poor as well as fund the government, which is wgat taxes are intended for by law. It is strange how Obama\u2019s own words haunt him now and how he denies their meaning. Plus between the plumber and others there seeems to be a vindictiveness when he/his campaign are pushed on issues and I never thought of Joe Biden as a mean man but he seems far meaner than the McCain we know has a temper but is, at heart, very kind. I prat our electorate knows what they are doing and in the end we have a fair and decent man leading us\u2026whomever it may be. Peace\u2026T\nI saw the Father\u2019s discussion on Cavuto\u2019s show.He gave an excellent discourse on Christian views on wealth and its distribution.It was virtually a perfect fit for Obama\u2019s policies,yet somehow the good Father concluded the opposite ! Even Mr. Cavuto said he couldn\u2019t understand his(the priest\u2019s) answers. However my problem is with Fox trying to mix religion and politics.What ever happened to separation of State and Religion?!\n\u201cThe necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich, and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.\u201d\nThat socialistic opinion comes from Adam Smith, author of the seminal work on modern capitalsm, who also believed that inheritance of estates was a preposterous notion, only justifiable to provide for underage orphans. Free market ideologues have completely lost their bearings and are not conservative in any sense. Also see the wise comment of Oliver Wendell Holmes: \u201d I like paying taxes. With them I buy civilization.\u201d\nWell said Kane. Additionally these so-called poor that they tell use are being left behind by our cruel capitalist system most have the following\u2026latest Nike shoes, housing, food, clothes, cell phones and cars.\nComment by michaelat\nOctober 27th, 2008 at 7:55 pm\nDear Father J -\nIf willful misinterpretation were a sin, you would be saying your Hail Marys right now.\nDid you read the quote from that Obama interview?

I have been a soldier. I have seen American men and women of all RACES and religions that courageously and proudly serve their country. Many of them made the ultimate sacrifice for their country with their lives. I read these comments putting down what these finest of Americans have done It makes me really ANGRY. These people that put our country down have NO appreciation of the freedoms that they have because of the sacrifice of these military heroes!!\nI know that in America we have problems and although it has taken a long time to fix many of these problems, we still FIX things. That is what Americans do. There have been racial problems but in 1862 there was slavery .A Christian republican president (Lincoln) issued the Emancipation Proclamation that ended the slavery and set our country on the road to racial equality. We are not entirely there yet but we have come a long way. It would have been impossible in years past for a black man like Obama to make 4million dollars a year not to mention actually run for president.\nThe capitalist system that he is trying to destroy has been really good to him.\nI have been around the world and I have seen \u201ccivilized\u201d socialist European countries that have a\n6o% tax rate on the working class in order to \u201cspread the wealth\u201d and few personal freedoms. I have seen third world countries where one in three babies die due to water born disease. I have also seen American Christian organizations voluntarily drilling wells to help these people survive. I have seen Americans risking their lives to provide medical assistance to people that have no access.\nWhen that enormous tsunami hit Indonesia, Who was there first??? America was there first. American Marines put down their weapons and began digging the out survivors as well as those who didn\u2019t survive. Americans set up water purification units to provide safe drinking water, setting up field hospitals aiding the injured, setting up temporary housing for these victims and food services for the victims. America was there FIRST!!\nI have seen countries where the middle class live in filthy squalor, with open sewers and trash in\nthe streets, living under oppressive totalitarian regimes. I have seen communists that plunder, murder, rape and torture the very people that they are supposedly \u201cliberating\u201d.\nYou people who want to believe that America is so bad really don\u2019t have a realistic view of\nthe world. NOWHERE in the world do people have a higher standard of living due to our\ncapitalist free market system. NOWHERE in the world do people have the personal rights that\nwe have in America. NOBODY in the world puts so much effort in to helping other people, even some that are not very friendly to us. NOBODY matches our humanitarian worldwide efforts. Why do you think that so many people want to get to America????\nYou people that put America down should really open your eyes and take a good honest look at the rest of the world. You should also question the anti-American ranting of people like Mr. Ayers, Mr. Wright and those associated with them. If these people had spouted this stuff in 90% of other countries, they would have been thrown in prison or would have wound up in an unmarked shallow grave somewhere. Instead Mr. Wright lives in a 1.2 million dollar home and Mr. Ayers is a professor in a prestigious university. Again, only in AMERICA\u2026..\nWake up America\u2026.Wake up!!!!\nFather J\u2026. you said Obama asserted \u201cit is a tragedy the civil rights movement failed to get the Supreme Court to venture into the issues of redistribution of wealth.\u201d He said exactly the OPPOSITE!!! He agreed that the Court did not should not have gone into distribution of wealth, and in fact he lamented the fact that the civil rights movement spent all its energy on court battles rather than legislative ones. For those who don\u2019t want the Courts acting in a legislative fashion, this should be music to your years. Without that misreading, your entire column is baseless and pointless.\nAnd what about this breathless prose: \u201cAnd we also know, by the dictates of reason and the practice of all ages, that when the government decides it can suspend the natural right to private property, through repossession or redistribution, or whatever they choose to call it, that government is on the wrong side of truth.\u201d Come on! The guy just wants the same tax structure that was in place during much of the Clinton years and that McCain was supporting eight years ago. Were they socialists?\nI know that some McCain folks are desperate because of the state of the polls, but please don\u2019t turn off your brains in order to convince yourself that Obama is something he\u2019s not.

American capitalism is an ideology (or a religion if you will) that stands in a stark opposition to practically all the world religions including Christianity. Capitalism calls to cultivate greed within an individual, it calls to consume endlessly turning the image of God into a consumer, it calls to compete with your fellow beings and defeat them, it calls for invading other countries for markets and resources.\nIn short Capitalism stands in opposition to the deepest spiritual traditions of the world. Capitalism is a religion of the beasts.\nAnd them Reps and Cons are trying to scare me with the socialism?

He IS leading us down a path of redistributing the wealth, class warfare politics, Daley-style government/ election corruption, fear-driven politics, and guiding our Judicial branch of government to \u201clegislate from the bench\u201d.\nWe must elect a president who respects the LAW, serves the honor and sacrifice, and has a clear history of experience and commitment to the United States of America, our values (LIFE, LIBERTY, and the PURSUIT of happiness), and most importantly our constitution.\nWhat an unfortunate choice of words Senator Obama made. If taxing the rich a bit more so the poorer can pay fewer taxes equates to all of you as an extreme redistribution of wealth, then I feel that there is little chance in reasoning with you. The \u201cwealth\u201d that will be spread will come from the poorer and less fortunate of this country who will take this \u201cwindfall\u201d that you seem to think they will reap and spend it on the extravagances of life - like heat for their homes, shoes for their children, food for their families. It is money that they need, have earned just like you and me, and will put into the economy because stashing in a CD or mutual fund is the furthest thing from their minds. The last eight years have seen an unconscionable increase in the disparity between the rich and poor. It is the greed that was preached from the bully pulpit of the White House that has taken us down the road to ruin and here we stand today on the precipice of financial oblivion, taking other nation\u2019s economies with us.\nThe defense of Joe the Plumber is one of the oddities of this Orwellian period of Republican-speak that will stick with me for a long, long time. Never have I seen so vigorous a defense of a fraud and tax scofflaw. How Christian it is that Joe, even though he lied and is a tax evader, will realize greater tax relief under Obama. How unlikely it is, should he be fortunate enough to make one-quarter million dollars income as a plumber, that that amount would be his true take home pay because he surely would need to cover his company\u2019s expenses. Even if he was fortunate to net that amount, I suspect he could afford the additional taxes. Heck, I could afford a bit more in taxes and I don\u2019t make nearly that much in income. But the difference between all of you and me is that I truly see the horrific mess we are in and am willing to make the sacrifices to help get us out of it - the bail outs, the wars, the defecit. Who do you expect or want to pay for all of that? I saw the lunacy of a Bush presidency early in 2000 when he became the front runner. Time has proven me right, tenfold. I don\u2019t like taxes any more than then next guy, but I\u2019m willing to do my part. Most all of you will pay fewer taxes under Obama - do me a favor, since he\u2019s so wrong, give the money back to pay for Bush\u2019s folly. This socialist nonsense that you all rant about is something else. Dig into your souls and contemplate what your heroes in the extremist right have done to this country. If you can\u2019t then see the light, then there is little hope.\nAll major religions of the world including Christianity (in its original version) call for the reduction of consumption, for controlling greed, for transcending hate, for peacemaking, for cultivating virtues like charity, and forgiveness. American capitalism is an ideology (or a religion if you will) that stands in a stark opposition to practically all the world religions including Christianity. Capitalism calls to cultivate greed within an individual, it calls to consume endlessly turning the image of God into a consumer, it calls to compete with your fellow beings and defeat them, it calls for invading other countries for markets and resources.\nIn short Capitalism stands in opposition to the deepest spiritual traditions of the world. Capitalism is a religion of the beasts.\nJesus was neither communist nor socialist. In fact, it was he who said, \u201cthe poor you will always have with you.\u201d Here\u2019s my own interpretation of what that means in this argument: if you redistribute the wealth of those who work to those who will not, they will still be poor because they have not learned the lessons that equate hard work with success. As the old adage says: Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime. Give a man someone else\u2019s catch of the day and he\u2019ll be back at the dock the next day waiting for the boat.\nComment by Debbie\nOctober 27th, 2008 at 7:23 pm\nHere\u2019s a good tax plan:\nAnd, in response to Valerie re: McCain\u2019s birth certificate, your argument does not make sense.

The law says the Mother has to be at least 19 if she lives in another Country in order to claim her child as a US citizen\u2026 I love how people get on here and TALK GARBAGE WITHOUT RESEARCHING FIRST!!\nThe fruit of my labor belongs to ME. Not to every smelly, dirty, deadbeat in the Head Count who thinks that I should pay for his bread and circuses just because I work for a living, and is intent on voting for the demagogue who promises it as the first salvo into the assault on the Constitution.\nI\u2019ve worked bloody hard for what I have, I know what it is to be on welfare, to be without health insurance while dealing with health issues, what it is to be raising a handicapped child, what it means to put myself through college while raising children, to pay for private school because the public school system is dangerous and inadequate, to worry about facing foreclosure from being out of work for two years, to caring for dying parents. Like I said - I\u2019ve worked hard, and paid my own way. Obama can keep his bloomin\u2019 fingers out of my pockets.\nWhat do you think you would get from Obama ,A ex-CRACK HEAD, maybe ex.\nHow do you think he can buy vote\u2019s in the slums. He will take your money, and tell you to work harder, them give your money to the one\u2019s that are TO LAZY TO WORK FOR THEM SELFs\u2026.\nYou now who I\u2019m taking about yes the ones that are to lazy to finish school, and just wait for that FREE hand out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSo look and see the real Obama, he\u2019s A REAL SOCIALIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThe little fandango out in Tennessee is logically connected to the level of political discourse found on this blog\u2026.connect the dots.\nThey are your political and ideological soul mates consumed by the same worldview\u2026and the same all consuming fear and loathing.\nTerrorist, secret Muslim, anti- american, socialist, anti-christ are all just code words\u2026at least the Tenn crew is honest about it. Hate is hate\u2026.any other argument rings hollow because they are disconnected from ther facts.\nWe have a guy who would put taxes back to where they were under mr reagan and clinton..yet he is a radical wealth distributor who will end our society as we know it? Was Reagan a Socialist? If the tax rate would be the same under Obama and Reagan then Regan must have been a Socialist to. Who knew? My own tax dollars currently flow to your gandpareant who depend on Social Security to get by - its called wealth redistribution. Maybe you should but\u2019em back to work and send me a rebate check?\nSo you all are either so blinded by your ideology that you can\u2019t think straight and see facts as facts (for example - the Republicans cut taxes on the wealthy, had the largest increase in spending in our history, drove the deficit to historical highs - leaving the next generation or two with a huge debt to repay - I can that radical distribution of wealth\u2026even McCain has distanced himself from this. The last guy Mr C eliminated the deficit, balanced the budget and kept taxes flat).\nYou if you not blinded by ideology then your are parrots that are easy to manipulate\u2026say after me..Socialist, Socialist, Socialist (hey, Palin jack up the tax rate on big oil and send every on check for $1,200 - isn\u2019t that socialism?)\nGiven this no semi-rational person would come to the conclusions exprerssed here is language that often borders on hate speech. Even McCain says Bush was an idiot who ruined the economy and let spending get out of control - how much of this are you missing?\nClearly there is something else afoot with the comments posted here - the answer can be found in Tennessee. You have been outted. You are the fringe.\nThis seems to be an odd position for the Church to take on this issue. [And I assume from his use of his title Father Jonathan is speaking officially as a representative of the Church.] Isn\u2019t the Church itself in the business of redistribution of wealth? And, like our Government, don\u2019t they take a healthy cut of the action during the process?\nAs far as his analysis of Obama goes I\u2019m at a complete loss. Did Obama compare himself to Robin Hood? I don\u2019t recall that. Maybe instead of focusing on \u201cwho is Robin Hood\u201d we should focus on \u201cWho is the Sheriff of Nottingham\u201d. How about CEOs that make bazillions in compensation and leave their companies in ruins? Maybe someone should fill them full of arrows and \u201credistribute\u201d that money back to the shareholders they stole it from?\n= = = = = = =\nAnd why is Father Jonathan so adamantly anti-Socialist? He himself says, \u201cThe great divide between the rich and the poor in our times is scandalous and reprehensible. And the blessings of this earth were destined by God for the common good of all his creatures.\u201d\nThat sounds like Socialist talk to me!\n= = = = = = =\nI\u2019m curious as to how many Conservatives who hate Socialism could even provide an accurate definition of what it is, without having to look it up.\nFather Morris certainly has the right to any opinion but please don\u2019t insult us by trying to justify it with erroneous history and a slanted reading law and let alone scripture. He says that Robin Hood was just because he was restoring to the poor what was lawfully theirs? What laws? The laws at the time said that only the Crown, the church and thoes it designated could own property. Their was no such thing as a right of the poor to own property.\nDid the Father even listen to the entire radio comment? If so, how did he miss the fact that Obama-a constitutional law scholar, was explaining exactly why the court was not the a proper vehicle for redistribution of wealth? He in fact says that step would have been radical and that the Warren Court wasn\u2019t radical because it didn\u2019t do it.\nWhile the father has the right to comment on whatever he likes, maybe it would be better if he stuck to subjects he actually knows somehting about?\nTax anyone who voted for Bush twice (or just for the 2nd term) at a very high rate since they agreed to have someone in office who caused a record debt and deficit. The people who did not vote for Bush are innocent victims to this mess and should be given a break.\nAnd, in response to Valerie re: McCain\u2019s birth certificate, your argument does not make sense. Obama was born to an American citizen, therefore he is an American citizen. Obama\u2019s birth certificate is on his website. Gee, check it out.\nCarolyn: I wish you had grown up as a minority in this country. It\u2019s ok, soon enough caucasians will be outnumbered by we minorities and you WILL BE the minority and you will feel what most of these people are feeling.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our Country needs\u2026 a Castro/Chavez wanna be President for this great Nation\u2026 Take from the hard working citizen, to give to the lazy don\u2019t wanna work citizen\u2026 I like your house, I kick you out and take your house away from you and give it to that same lazy don\u2019t wanna work citizen\u2026 we\u2019ll all have \u201csocialized medicine\u201d which means, we won\u2019t have anything\u2026 people will be dropping dead in ER waiting to see a doctor.. We\u2019ll all be indigents and treated as such.. look at all the countries that practice this, they come to our country to get treated b/c they can not get treated in their own countries\u2026 we will be just like any other 3rd world country if this socialist/communist gets elected\u2026\nSince you all obviously strongly believe Obama\u2019s plan to redistribute the wealth to the middle class is so great, and since I\u2019m definitely in the middle class, if Obama\u2019s elected, come January 21, I\u2019ll be sure to send you the bill for my wardrobe, health insurance, etc. After all, why wait \u2014 you can show your faith in his plan by redistributing your wealth - to me!\nJust look at all of these comments left by these \u201cOpen Minded\u201d individuals, after reading most of the comments left on this page I have seen that if you are going to vote for Obama you are obviously a better person,more moral, smarter, well at least in their own opinion,and this is why they are voting for a Communist, because Obama also feels the same way he won\u2019t let us make any more mistakes like we did when we voted for Mccain,poor dumb Christians,they need to be told how to live their lives\u2026For their own good though,and keeping the money you earned for yourself or your family is obviously wrong,according to Obama and all of these other \u201cPink Nazi\u2019s\u201d.\nObama is a true Marxist tell the Poor the world is unfair because of the rich,and almost as if he was taught by Marx himself he diagnosed religion as a disease that you get when you are scared or unhappy with your life while talking to radicals in San Francisco,he is not a christian,or even a muslim he is a Communist.\nThen for any person who considers their self a Christian and that person would choose a world where unborn children can be murdered for any cause, and would choose to take a another mans money instead of working for it and at the same moment spit on the graves and in the faces of those who fight for freedom and liberty for another man who they themselves do not know then you my brother do not know Christ and I pray you seek out the truth before the end.\nComment by Tom\nOctober 27th, 2008 at 6:58 pm\nIt is a wonderful sight to behold - to watch Reps and Cons be so scared of Obama that they get weak in their knees and start peeing in their panties.\n\u2014I\u2019d rather pee my panties than to have the government pi$$ down my throat. Open wide!!!\nJust to clarify - you are applauding someone who acts like a vigilante to remedy past wrongs, but criticizing someone who would choose to work through legal channels to do the same?\nThe Catholic Catechism (paragraph 2409) might be instructive here, as it perhaps identifies some of the wrongs Obama speculated might be remedied through law. I point your attention to \u201cpaying unjust wages\u201d (could that have led to historic wealth imbalances, perhaps) and price manipulation:\nEven if it does not contradict the provisions of civil law, any form of unjustly taking and keeping the property of others is against the seventh commandment: thus, deliberate retention of goods lent or of objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; forcing up prices by taking advantage of the ignorance or hardship of another.\nThe following are also morally illicit: speculation in which one contrives to manipulate the price of goods artificially in order to gain an advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in which one influences the judgment of those who must make decisions according to law; appropriation and use for private purposes of the common goods of an enterprise; work poorly done; tax evasion; forgery of checks and invoices; excessive expenses and waste. Willfully damaging private or public property is contrary to the moral law and requires reparation.\nTo those of you that claim to be Catholics and support Obama, well that\u2019s an Oxymoron\u2026 The Catholic Church is very clear on its principles against abortion\u2026 so don\u2019t ever take Communion\u2026you will die in Hell\u2026\nAlso, a Catholic or ANY human being support Obama when he\u2019s signed the bill for \u201clate term abortions\u201d\u2026 that\u2019s when a baby is born alive, out of a botched abortion and then is kept inside a bedpan in the dirty linen closet until it dies\u2026 HOW CAN ANY HUMAN BEING, THAT IS A DECENT AND MORAL PERSON VOTE FOR A MAN THAT SUPPORTS THAT\u2026 Let\u2019s say a woman gives birth prematurely and the baby is born alive, but she decides that instead of seeking immediate attention, she lets the baby die, what do you think is going to happen to the Mother???? SHE\u2019S GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH MURDER\u2026 SO HOW SOMEONE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY BE IN FAVOR OF SUCH A DESPICABLE ACT?\nComment by anti-Obama\nOctober 27th, 2008 at 7:01 pm\n\u201cIn that context, to discuss redistribution of wealth is more akin to compensating crime victims who had been raped by the law itself.\u201d\nRaped by whom? My parents immigrated to this country long after slavery was abolished. The vast majority of Americans today have not even the slightest connection to slavery. Slavery ended 150 years ago, get over it.\n============\nThey are talking about repariations\u2026which is getting somethng for nothing. You would think they would have been taking advantage of the last 40 ears to do something about it by using all the preferential treatment they have been getting. I\u2019m tired of it. Maybe we should do them like Obama wants to do Iraq and pull that rug out of under them and make them swim on their own.\nanti-Obama: I don\u2019t see any of the executives from AIG or Lehman Brothers donating to charity the extra money they made from the stock options they received. I don\u2019t see any of the guys involved in the Enron mess donating to charity what they defrauded their employees of. Again, the problem is the human element and greed.\nRobin Hood would be proud of the efforts of presidentail canidate Barack Obama .Though the world is much bigger than then.The task will be bigger than Robin Hood could ever imagine.We have a major wealth difference in this country thats starving the middleclass and the poor to death.This is a historical tragedy.Beyond all boundaries and around the world the rich have squeezed the living daylights out of all us hardworking people that make pennys to live on as they live fat and high on a pedestal made of ruthless immoral and cutthroat behaviour.Its time we hardworking poor people stand up for what we believe in.And thats fair treatment and the right to live decently\nSearch this Blog\nADVERTISEMENT\nAbout FOX Forum\nHome to the most opinionated contributors on FOX News Channel, the FOX\nForum brings fair and balanced analysis to the web!

THE PLEDGE IS ON DREAM THAT WE ALL KNOW WILL NEVER COME TRUE!\nI will tell you about America!! I have been a soldier. I have seen American men and women of all RACES and religions that courageously and proudly serve their country. Many of them made the ultimate sacrifice for their country with their lives. When I read these comments putting down what these finest of Americans have done It makes me really ANGRY. These people that put our country down have NO appreciation of the freedoms that they have because of the sacrifice of these military heroes!!\nI know that in America we have problems and although it has taken along time to fix many of these problems, we still FIX things. That is what Americans do.There have been racial problems but in 1862 there was slavery. a Christian republican president (lincoln) issued the Emancipation Proclamation that ended the slavery and set our country on the road to racial equality. We are not entirely there yet but we have come along way. It would have been impossible in years past for a black man like Obama to make 4million dollars a year not to mention actually run for president.\nThe capitalist system that he is trying to destroy has been really good to him.\nI have been around the world and I have seen \u201ccivilised\u201d socialist European countries that have a\n6o% tax rate on the working class in order to \u201cspread the wealth\u201dand NO personal rights. I have seen third world countries where one in three babies die due to water born disease. I have also seen American Christian organizations voluntarily drilling wells to help these people survive. I have seen Americans risking their lives to provide medical assistance to people that have no access.\nWhen that enormous sunami hit Indonesia, Who was there first??? America was there first. American Marines put down their weapons and began digging the out survivors as well as those who didn\u2019t survive. Americans set up water purification units to provide safe drinking water, setting up field hospitals aiding the injured, setting up temporary housing for these victims and food services for the victims. America was there FIRST!!\nI have seen countries where the middle class live in filthy squalor, with open sewers and trash in\nthe streets. Living under oppressive totalitarian regimes. I have seen communists that plunder, murder, rape and torture the very people that they are supposedly \u201cliberating\u201d.\nYou people who want to believe that America is so bad really don\u2019t have a realistic view of\nthe world.

NOBODY in the world puts so much effort in to helping other people, even some that are not very friendly to us. NOBODY matches our humanitarian worldwide efforts. Why do you think that so many people want to get to America????\nYou people that put America down should really open your eyes and take a good honest look at the rest of the world. You should also question the anti-American rantings of people like Mr. Ayers,\nMr. Wright and those associated with them. If these people had spouted this stuff in 90% of\nother countries, they would have been thrown in prison or would have wound up in an unmarked\nshallow grave somewhere.

In my humble opinion, the only way we\u2019re going to return to these basic moral and ethical behaviors in our country is to return to a society based on the sound teachings of religion and the Bible. Until we do that, we will continue to spiral out of control. Yes, we\u2019ll be able to put \u201cband-aids\u201d on certain problems (housing crisis, stock market, CEO compensation, etc), but at some point all these band-aids will no longer stop the bleeding and we will hemorage (forgive me if I misspelled that)!\nHolding politicians accountable is problematic.

And they\u2019re ALL blaming the media (except loyal Fox, thepropoganda arm ofthe right, the Al Jazeera of the neocon jihadists. They\u2019ve even started calling right-leaning columnists like George Will and Frum, \u201celitists\u201d! (They\u2019ve got educations past the 8th grade?!?)\nAnd it\u2019ll get louder and whinier when Obama beats Mclame next Tuesday. So don\u2019t bother to offertotake the pledge out of thy neighbor\u2019s eye when you have a lumberyard of hypocrisy in thine own!\nSo how comeyou guys won\u2019t post my comment about how thelosing Mccain team is blaming each other and everybody else, and how the whingin will get worse WHEN Obama wins? Am I being too uncomfortably truthful for Fox?\nYou know, the idea behind communism is that everyone is equal, everyone is fair, and therefore everyone can share everything and be happy. It\u2019s Utopia. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case; the human race is competitive, and for Utopia that\u2019s a bad thing. For progress, however, that\u2019s a good thing.\nLet\u2019s face reality! The only thing we can do, is to find those that cheat and punish them. That should leave the good people to vote. We need to abolish ACORN, and put the right checks and balances in place, (maybe then the Dallas Cowboys will not vote in Nevada).\nON THE ECONOMY\nJohn McCain said it in his own words: He just doesn\u2019t understand the economy. His economic plan would give big tax breaks to corporations and tax workers\u2019 health care benefi ts. We call on McCain to help turn around America, not choose corporations over working families.\nMcCAIN ATTACKED MEDICARE\nMcCain: I Never Really Understood Economics.

I am running because of the transcendental challenge of the 21st century, which is radical Islamic extremism.\u201d (The New York Times, 1/28/08)\nBut Economic Issues Top Working Family Concerns.

We are approaching the 7,000,000,000 (7B!!) population number, and there are people all over te world starving to death. How are you people going to manage more people on the planet? When (according to your bible) God said \u201cGo forth and multiply\u201d, I don\u2019t think he meant \u201cgo forth like a bunch of brainless rabbits and populate the planet so that you choke it to death and have people dying of hunger all over the planet!!\u201d\nI would love to see politicians from both parties take that pledge. No excuses allowed! If you do something, or neglect to do something, and it results in negative consequences, be a man (or a woman) and own up to it. Personal responsibility is something that has been falling by the wayside in our country for quite some time, and the lack of accountability that results is frustrating. I personally respect a politician more if he can stand up and admit his mistakes - that\u2019s one of the things I like best about John McCain, and I hope Obama will emulate him in that respect if he\u2019s elected in November.\nThe United States Constitution is the backbone of its citizens.\nThat\u2019s why the U.S.A is more than 200 years old and counting.\nI don\u2019t care who or what Barck Obama is. One thing\u2019s for sure,Barack Obama is not an american. Obama will not defend the U.S. constitution\nMcCain\u2019s Tax Cuts Would Cut Social Programs Working Families Need. \u201cMcCain cannot pay for his tax cuts without massive reductions in Social Security, Medicare or other key programs that benefit the vast majority of Americans.\u201d (\u201cFive Easy Pieces and Two Trillion Dollars,\u201d Center for American Progress Action Fund, 3/21/08)\n____________\nThere is some much trash here it is hard clear the deck. First McCain cuts won\u2019t touch SS, since they are paid for dedicated taxes. The last 10 yrs has seen one of the largest increases in entitlement spending since LBJ, part of the reason fo rthe deficit. Obama wants to go further.\nThe economy has produced one of the largest net increases in jobs over the last 10 yrs, despite the Dot.COm bust (inherited), 9/11, and the global war on terror.\nCorporate taxes are the seocnd heighest for an industrialized country in the worl, making us less competitive. Why invest here if it cheaper in China, wages and taxes. Hmmm.\nP.S. - You pay corporate taxes through the prices you pay for their products.\nHealth care wuld become a taxable benfit, but you get a $5000 tax cedit for health insurance. All part of plan to create market for portable individual policies, as opposed to a plan to drive everyone to e government plan - and the Government has asuch a long history of providing efficient services.\nThe top 10% of income pay 50% of the tax burden, while 40% pay none\u2026 what is there to complain about other than everyone is not paying their way.\nMcCain was a leading proponent of reigning in Freddie and Fannie, a major cause to the mrotagage problem. The Senate Democrats block every effort to control these entities, while promoting Alt-A nd sub-prime loans. HMMMM\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nThe economy is a problem becasue of too much government help and intervention not too little regulation.\nWhile your ideas are great have you seriously considered the economic impact. Newspapers would have little to report. All of the \u2019spinsters\u2019 that politicians hire would no longer have a high paying job. Companies could get rid of PR departments.\nI guess to counter that would be the fact that if folks on welfare of one kind or another looked in the mirror and took responsiblity for themselves then we would soon not have any more welfare. While that sounds good we would once again put out of work all of those people that make a really good living making sure a few pennies on the dollar make it to the actual people that are supposed to get welfare. Of course if these two expenses in the Federal government dried up then without raising taxes we could pay off the current Federal deficit in less than a decade while rebuilding our infrastructure.\nI like your idea and while it could solve most of the problems in our country I just don\u2019t see it happening. It is something that we can all do without government intervention so it will never happen.\nComment by DUH!\nOctober 27th, 2008 at 3:51 pm\nWhat I would like an answer to is this:\nIf America\u2019s biggest nightmare comes true, and McCain and Palin steal the election, they will appoint pro-life rednecks to the SUpreme Court.

Overturning Roe V. Wade doesn\u2019t make abortion illegal, but turns it back to the states tot decide. This is a Federal Republic don\u2019t you know. People have other means fo controllign their baby making than abortion. The parent shoudl be responsible, they made the baby.\nWe produce more than enough food (except when we try to make ethanol to drive with) for everyone, we have a distribution problem not a production problem. We are human, the expectation is that we can act better than rabbits so abortion is unnecessary.\nComment by Jim Keenan\nOctober 27th, 2008 at 2:01 pm\nAs Biden said when recently asked if Obama was a Socialist(or was it a Marxist)\u2014are you joking?

See the latest on Obama\u2019s interview on NPR. The civil rights movement was not radical enough in redistributive agenda.\nThis is all well and good except Pelosi, Dodd, Reid, Franks and Obama could not keep the pledge. When all else fails blame the Population. Besides they would not know the truth if it hit them up beside the Head especially if the truth was about them, I wish I was so stupid I could convence myself I have never been wrong. If you don\u2019t believe just ask them, they have never admitted to any mistakes.\nI encourage everyone to read the book \u201cThe Red President\u201d by Martin Gross. It was written like 20 years ago so it\u2019s not an author capitalizing on the current story. However, some things are striking:\nFor one, it includes a Chicago lawyer who is left. It mentions the Weathermen. It deals with a nominee to who is socialist. There are other similiarities that are escaping me right now. But I think it odd that the book is ahead of its time.\nDespite the usual commentary of extremists a zealots in response to this piece, I support pretty much every word. This comes from an ex-crackhead that, with a lot of help, was able to pull myself out of a terrible hole. As I pulled myself out I began to see how much I had blamed the world for my ills. Granted, I had a bad start. It\u2019s called a \u201cdysfunctional childhood\u201d nowadays. But my mistakes were mine. Each person who reads this needs to take some responsibility while remembering how complex and simple our lives really are.\n\u201cBut what if all of us reversed the paradigm? Instead of blaming other people and outside forces and making excuses, what if we began by taking responsibility, taking action, and refusing to lie, about our real agenda, the real risks and the real results?\u201d\nWords to live by.\nFrom where I stand there really is only one candidate who overall hasn\u2019t been playing the, \u201cIt\u2019s his/thier\u201d fault, whether the \u201cthey\u201d is racism, sexism, party line, or the media. Only one candidate has CONSISTENTLY NOT blamed some outside force using words of the week/day, and has instead embraced a need for all of us to work together as united Americans.\nThose of you incapable of hearing and thinking about another point of view might need to reevaluate your thinking, or maybe you will all just resort to violence as has been the historical pattern. I hope you will come talk to me before deciding the latter as an ignorant mob, but we will see.\nOctober 24th, 2008 at 8:22 pm\nI will tell you about America!! I have been a soldier. I have seen American men and women of all RACES and religions that courageously and proudly serve their country. Many of them made the ultimate sacrifice for their country with their lives. I read these comments putting down what these finest of Americans have done It makes me really ANGRY. These people that put our country down have NO appreciation of the freedoms that they have because of the sacrifice of these military heroes!!\nI know that in America we have problems and although it has taken a long time to fix many of these problems, we still FIX things. That is what Americans do. There have been racial problems but in 1862 there was slavery .A Christian republican president (Lincoln) issued the Emancipation Proclamation that ended the slavery and set our country on the road to racial equality. We are not entirely there yet but we have come a long way. It would have been impossible in years past for a black man like Obama to make 4million dollars a year not to mention actually run for president.\nThe capitalist system that he is trying to destroy has been really good to him.\nI have been around the world and I have seen \u201ccivilized\u201d socialist European countries that have a\n6o% tax rate on the working class in order to \u201cspread the wealth\u201d and few personal freedoms. I have seen third world countries where one in three babies die due to water born disease. I have also seen American Christian organizations voluntarily drilling wells to help these people survive. I have seen Americans risking their lives to provide medical assistance to people that have no access.\nWhen that enormous tsunami hit Indonesia, Who was there first??? America was there first. American Marines put down their weapons and began digging the out survivors as well as those who didn\u2019t survive. Americans set up water purification units to provide safe drinking water, setting up field hospitals aiding the injured, setting up temporary housing for these victims and food services for the victims. America was there FIRST!!\nI have seen countries where the middle class live in filthy squalor, with open sewers and trash in\nthe streets, living under oppressive totalitarian regimes. I have seen communists that plunder, murder, rape and torture the very people that they are supposedly \u201cliberating\u201d.\nYou people who want to believe that America is so bad really don\u2019t have a realistic view of\nthe world. NOWHERE in the world do people have a higher standard of living due to our\ncapitalist free market system. NOWHERE in the world do people have the personal rights that\nwe have in America. NOBODY in the world puts so much effort in to helping other people, even some that are not very friendly to us. NOBODY matches our humanitarian worldwide efforts. Why do you think that so many people want to get to America????\nYou people that put America down should really open your eyes and take a good honest look at the rest of the world. You should also question the anti-American ranting of people like Mr. Ayers, Mr. Wright and those associated with them. If these people had spouted this stuff in 90% of other countries, they would have been thrown in prison or would have wound up in an unmarked shallow grave somewhere. Instead Mr. Wright lives in a 1.2 million dollar home and Mr. Ayers is a professor in a prestigious university. Again, only in AMERICA\u2026..\nWake up America\u2026.Wake up!!!!\nWho ever said OBAMA is not an american. YOU are wrong. Last I recalled and was in Geograpy and HIstory CLass Hawaii Was a state. IS is it not? SO you saying all those military children born over seas on an american installation are not americans even if they are defending our country as we speak. I dont know about you but my husband was born in Germany on an american base there and he has defended our country many times, operation anaconda, operation iraqi freedom and countless others. So please don\u2019t go saying someone isn\u2019t an american just because of their race or where they were born\nIt is clear that no one is on the fence in this discussion. Everyone is either for McCain or for Obama.\nMcCain was never part of the conservative right and Obama is not very left wing. They are couple of moderats playing to their base to get elected.\nThey will Preside from the center. They will both use a liberal Democratic Congress and a conservative Supreme Court as excuses for not doing what they promised.\nThis is an outstanding article. We\u2019ve become a nation of people incapable of taking responsibility for ourselves or our actions. It is always \u201csomeone else\u2019s fault\u201d and we look for a way out, an escape from paying the price for our decisions and blunders. And our government is US. There is no accountability. Congress has so insulated itself that even when we can see and hear the culprits who have failed us, we can\u2019t get hold of them. We have the means \u2014 voting! But we can\u2019t blame government if we don\u2019t bother to inform ourselves and act on what we see. We are failing ourselves. We must blame ourselves. We must take responsibility ourselves. And only when we do this, can we begin to change our government. Transparency would go a long way toward cleaning things up and getting the business done but, again, it begins with US. The citizens of this country will continue to have failed government if they only notice what\u2019s happening in Washington every four years - IF that.\nFew words about Capitalism. All major religions of the world including Christianity (in its original version) call for the reduction of consumption, for controlling greed, for transcending hate, for peacemaking, for cultivating virtues like charity, and forgiveness. American capitalism is an ideology (or a religion if you will) that stands in a stark opposition to practically all the world religions including Christianity. Capitalism calls to cultivate greed within an individual, it calls to consume endlessly turning the image of God into a consumer, it calls to compete with your fellow beings and defeat them, it calls for invading other countries for markets and resources.\nIn short Capitalism stands in opposition to the deepest spiritual traditions of the world. Capitalism is a religion of the beasts.\nAnd them Reps and Cons are trying to scare me with the socialism? Lol.\nKane: Thanks for serving! You are an American more people should listen to! They should also try reading the Constitution. I hope you\u2019re not going to give up your weapons when they start passing gun control legislation( 1st 100 days, count on it)\nTom:\nyou should be afraid of socialism because of the result of socialism. Not because of what you perceive as conservatives trying to scare you with it. The result is always dictators who oppress religion. Capitalism in America does NOT oppress religion, never has never will. It\u2019s called Freedom and cannot be tolerated in a socialist society and is always repressed.\nBetter read your history folks. IT CAN HAPPEN HERE!\nNO Excuses pledge is a wonderful idea, it is the one I was brought up with, along with an excellent work ethic. I was also taught to help my fellow man, but that the government is not the answer to my or anyone elses problems. To help someone should always be voluntary. Here is the deal, based upon Obama\u2019s tax plan I would not pay any taxes because of my income and the fact that there are 4 members in my family, I would not pay any under McCain either\u2026the difference is under McCain I get to keep my job, because under Obama the government is going to tax the company I work for in an insane way.\nTherefore under McCain I would get to keep my job, continue providing for my family, have some expendendable dollars, and my children can continue to be homeschooled and we will probably adopt one more child. And thus we will still be supporting the small and large businesses around us because we will have disposable income. Additionally, my salary will continue to rise as long as I continue to do a good job.\nUnder Obama I will not pay any taxes but I will also probably not be able to keep my job, because if my company\u2019s taxes increase then in order for them to stay in business they will have to reduce their work force around the nation, now on the off chance I do get to keep my job then my salary will not increase because we will have cutbacks and more than likely I will have to work more hours because we will have less people to do the same amount of work, therefore I have less time to do main jobs of being a wife and mom. So as prices continue to rise, my salary does not increase or I have no job at all, therefore I cannot afford to spend money at small and large businesses, additionally, there is not enough money to effectively parent another traumatized child through adoption, and my children have less parental involvement.\nWhat folks are not looking at is the long term consquences of expecting the government to take care of the population. Raise taxes people lose their jobs and and have less disposable income or their company cannot afford to give them a raise\u2026so prices increase to pay for the corporate taxes yet people either have no job or less salary to pay those prices, this leads to more layoffs, more government intervention\u2026Additionally, it inhibts people for reaching out and helping others.\nWe are meant to work, to succeed and fail, and to improve, we are not meant to look to the government to solve our problems\u2026\nThe comment by Tom is spot-on; Jesus called for those of us who have two coats to give one to the poor. IN Acts, the Apostles and disciples are described as \u201csharing what each one had, equally.\u201d In other words\u2026JESUS WAS A SOCIALIST!! And so was the early (as opposed to post-first-century) church as described in The Acts of the Apostles.\nObama once said that he was not a Book of Leviticus (\u201dThou Shalt Not\u2026\u201d) Christian, but a Sermon on the Mount (\u201dgive to those in needwithout expecting anything in return\u201d) Christian. Amen, Barack Obama!\nyou misunderstood the comment. Read it again. An American citizen abides by its Constitution and defends it. Take your time if you need it to understand this, it\u2019s ok. You are confused but you can overcome this.\n1. Occidental College records \u2014 Not released\n2. Columbia College records \u2014 Not released\n3.

The only one we are to lean on and count on is God not the government. And Jesus never said from each according to ability to each according to his need, He did tell us to give sacrificially, but he never demanded it, it is voluntary, and should be done with a servants heart\u2026.it should never be forced upon anyone\u2026\nWhen a candidate regards the unborn child as unworthy of the defense of law, then he asks us to join them in ignoring the lessons of history by which blacks in this country were once regarded as non-persons; or the people of Europe were once marked for genocide or racial purification. Had we known, would we have supported the \u201cchoice\u201d to enslave or destroy these brothers and sisters of ours?\n\u201cNo excuses\u201d was made famous by Donna Rice and Gary Hart. Barack has no excuses and no explanation for his past relationships with disreputable people. His monkey business will be revealed\u2026possibly in impeachment proceedings.\n\u2013 Taxes will be raised on the top 5 percent of wage-earners, who now carry 60 percent of the U.S. income tax burden, and tens of millions of checks will be sent out to the 40 percent of wage-earners who pay no federal income tax. Like the man said, redistribute the wealth, spread it around.\n\u2013 A \u201cFreedom of Choice Act\u201d nullifying all state restrictions on abortions will be enacted.

I've recounted on television, radio and on these pages all the dismal statistics that put President Obama's failed legacy into sharp relief. I\u2019m not going to go through them all again, but suffice to say that by nearly every measure \u2013 the labor force participation rate, welfare rolls, the number of people on food stamps \u2013 we are much worse off after enduring eight years of Obama.\nBut it is crucial to remember that there are real people behind the numbers. These are your family members. These are your friends, your colleagues, your neighbors. They are real Americans, and their suffering is all too genuine. They are the forgotten men and women who Donald Trump spoke about and directly to during his historic and successful campaign.\nTrump the candidate made a lot of promises in what he called his contract with the American voter. There were very specific promises for his first 100 days, including lowering taxes, reforming the tax code, negotiating free but fair trade deals to protect American workers, fixing our nation's infrastructure, sending education back to the states, promoting school choice, repealing and replacing ObamaCare, ending illegal immigration and rebuilding our nation's military.\nIf President Trump can keep those promises, this country will be in a much better place one year from now, two years from now and four years from now.\nMy advice to the incoming president is very simple: Don't let the Washington establishment, which includes Republicans, Democrats and the media, get in the way of accomplishing your bold agenda.\nThe Bible tells us that where there is no vision and no insight, the people perish. Right now, America desperately needs a revitalization, and Donald Trump, this is your opportunity. You can be the person to make it happen.\nCongratulations, President Trump, and the country wishes you the best.", "\nHow do you solve a problem like the Clintons?\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks at an event hosted by the Center for American Progress (CAP) and the America Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Monday, March 23, 2015, in Washington.

I'll tell you why: Because she, or someone else, has wiped it clean and we are to take her word for it that there was nothing there before it was wiped.\nOne doesn't have to think long or hard about how this would play if Hillary Clinton were a Republican (which she once was). Liberal editorialists and commentators would be screaming about a cover-up, her questionable ethics, her unfitness to be president and calling for someone else to challenge her.\nAll Hillary Clinton would have to do to keep this latest outrage from becoming even more outrageous is to turn over the server to an independent third party, as requested by Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, who heads a special House committee looking into the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.\n\"Why can't Hillary Clinton just hand over the email server she kept in her home for \"private\" emails?\nRecall that Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen testified under oath before a congressional committee and claimed that the emails of Lois Lerner, the IRS' former director of the Exempt Organizations Unit, had been \"lost\" and the IRS servers unrecoverable, only to later discover they were not lost and were, in fact, recovered.\nIf Hillary Clinton has nothing to hide, she will hand over the server. Truly private emails can be kept private. Any others that survived erasure should be revealed, or this will \u2014 and should \u2014 hang over her anticipated presidential candidacy, along with other dark clouds.\nFormer Bill Clinton aide turned political pundit, Dick Morris, says that neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton types well, and email messages longer than a few words were likely composed and sent by aides from the aides' own email accounts. Those servers and email records should also be subpoenaed for examination by an independent investigator. You can bet the Obama Justice Department won't do anything. Was that one of the reasons Hillary spent an hour with President Obama last week at the White House?\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is expected to announce his presidential candidacy in April, has vowed to make Hillary Clinton's ethics \u2014 or lack of them \u2014 a major part of his campaign. He should. The Clintons have a lot of political baggage; so much, in fact, that if their political baggage were real baggage, they'd likely be charged an overweight fee on any commercial airliner. But, of course, they fly private.\nThe big question is: Will the public care? We expect so little of our politicians these days that ethics and morals don't seem to matter as much as they once did, as long as those government checks keep coming. By not expecting more, we get less. We get less because the people we elect to public office often reflect the ethical concerns and practices of the country.\nNow back to \"The Sound of Music.\" How do you solve a problem like the Clintons?

This move, like the airstrikes, was meant to reassure the country\u2019s Copts that they were equal citizens in the new Egypt.\nInstead, Al Our\u2019s proposed church has become a symbol of the Egypt Sisi claims is no more -- an Egypt in which Christians suffer violence for their religion and are treated as second-class citizens.\nOn March 27, as Al Our Christians gathered in the small local church to commemorate their town\u2019s new martyrs, an angry mob gathered after Friday Muslim prayers. A week earlier, a mob had marched in the village streets chanting \u201cNo church on the land,\u201d but this time the bigoted slogans were accompanied by Molotov cocktails and stones thrown at the church and homes of one of the beheading victims and other Christians.\nThat local Muslims would be so incensed by the prospect of a church in their village points to the extreme culture of intolerance that has come to dominate segments of Egyptian society. These residents are not necessarily members of the Muslim Brotherhood or of other Islamist groups, or even personally all that religious. Permitting Christians to build a church simply is now widely perceived by Muslim villagers in Egypt as an insult to them and to Islam.\nIt is the response of the local authorities that is most disturbing.\nBut, it is the response of the local authorities that is most disturbing. Rather than prosecuting and bringing to justice those attacking the Al Our Christians, the governor ordered a reconciliation session between the representatives of both communities \u2013 that is, a handshake of forgiveness by the aggrieved Christians. Sidestepping the criminal justice system, such sessions have long been a hallmark of the government\u2019s approach to assaults against Coptic Christians and have created a climate of impunity and a culture of encouragement.\nWhile in past similar incidents, any plan to build a church would have been scrapped, this one could not be, as it was promised by the Egyptian president himself. Instead, the governor agreed to the mob\u2019s demand of banishing the proposed church to the village outskirts. The seven men arrested for their role in the attack were released to close the matter and appease the mob.\nThe Al Our episode comes shortly after an attack on Christians in El Galaa village. There, too, the mob was enflamed by the prospects of a new church, but it was one to replace an older church. After throwing rocks at Christian homes and terrorizing their residents, the mob made its demands known. They had no quarrel with Christians existing or praying; what incensed them was the prospect of a Christian house of worship desecrating their village. Christians could have a building to pray in, but it could not appear to be a church. It had to be devoid of any symbol of Christianity: no dome or cross, no tower or bell, and the entrance was to be located on a side street. Thus are the new rules of Dhimmitude being enforced in Egyptian villages. In El Galaa, the mob prevailed and the church was not built.\nPresident Sisi has courageously spoken of a need for a religious revolution and of the need to change the religious discourse fueling hatred. He has similarly spoken of saving the Egyptian state from collapsing like others in the region. If Sisi is serious about both, then he must turn his words into actions by upholding the rule of law, prosecuting those attacking Christians, and offering police protection for the Christians of Al Our.\nSamuel Tadros is a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute\u2019s Center for Religious Freedom.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)THE ASSOCIATED PRESS2014\nOne of the reasons our political structure has become dysfunctional no matter which party is in power is that too many of us are living in the moment. The closest we get to history is the instant replay.\nIt is as if there is nothing the past can teach us; no wisdom that might be culled from those who have gone before. We buy guidebooks, or go online for information about countries or cities we plan to visit, trusting those who have been there to tell us the best places to stay, see and eat. When it comes to more momentous things, like health care, too many people believe government does best, regardless of historical and even contemporary evidence to the contrary.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe well-known quote \"That government is best which governs least,\" often attributed to Henry David Thoreau, has been supplanted in our day by the notion that government is my keeper, I shall not want.\nAll of the promises about health care \"reform\" are proving dubious at best. The move from insurance exchanges to single payer to the eventual takeover of the health care industry will happen incrementally, but inevitably, unless Republicans win back control of government and have the courage to repeal and replace ObamaCare with something better.\nWhen the dollar becomes almighty, the Almighty who creates life takes a backseat.\nWhat should awaken apathetic Americans is a story in last week's The New York Times headlined, \"Cost of Treatment May Influence Doctors.\" The story said some of the country's largest medical groups are now suggesting that physicians consider cost when treating patients. The Times says a subtle shift is taking place within medicine as \"doctors are starting to redefine their roles, from being concerned exclusively about individual patients to exerting influence on how health care dollars are spent.\"\nIn other words, are you \"worth\" being treated for cancer or other illnesses that can cost a lot of money? When government pressures health care providers to accept a utilitarian view of human life, it is a short step to government deciding whose life is worth living and whose is not.\nWhen the dollar becomes almighty, the Almighty who creates life takes a backseat.\nPromises that the misnamed Affordable Care Act would reduce costs are already being proved wrong. Health care spending is surging, according to another New York Times story. President Obama promised it would decline. We heard similar promises 50 years ago when Medicare was introduced. Politicians then promised costs would never exceed a certain level, which they did in very short order.\nCritics of ObamaCare say one of its objectives is to put insurance companies out of business. The UnitedHealth Group is one of the nation's largest. It recently reported lower earnings and said the health care law is partially responsible.\nThe \"sound of inevitability,\" to quote from the film \"The Matrix,\" can be heard across the Atlantic. The National Health Service (NHS) continues to sputter as its experiment in socialized medicine produces horror stories that could be replicated in the United States if government is ever allowed to control not only insurance, but treatment.\nA UK Daily Mail story tells of a great-grandmother who died in agony at Manchester Royal Infirmary. She suffered from a perforated bowel and while she screamed in pain for help she was told a nearby doctor, who was playing on a computer, \"wasn't on duty.\" Stories of neglect, long waits for treatment, insensitivity toward patients and unusual numbers of deaths in some UK hospitals are no longer exceptions, but are increasingly common.\nWhy do so many have faith in government when government has a track record of failure and incompetence in the many tasks it undertakes? How can government be expected to miraculously acquire competence when it comes to health care?\nReal faith is based on something substantive, not false hope.

He fed the common misconception that clemency is only for people who want to get out of prison. Headlines read, \u201cThousands of prisoners could qualify for clemency,\u201d and \u201cObama seeks wider authority to release drug offenders.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\n\u201cRelease the prisoners\u201d messaging does not bode well with most Americans. Rather than focus on current inmates and blame \u201cthe old regime,\u201d Holder should have spoken about the administration\u2019s desire to pardon millions of Americans who never served a day in prison yet live as convicted felons for a crime they committed many years ago. These people blame nobody but themselves for their crimes and they have become contributing members of society.\nAndrew McCarthy (who commented to Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly about the initiative) wrote, \u201cThis exercise is another transparent usurpation of legislative power by the president. The pardon power is just the camouflage for it. The pardon power exists so that the president can act in individual cases to correct excesses and injustices. It is not supposed to be a vehicle by which presidents rewrite congressional statutes that they disagree with philosophically\u2026\u201d\nMcCarthy is wrong: The pardon power is executive; it is not legislative. The pardon power is not a congressional statute. It is \u201cenumerated\u201d (written in the Constitution of the United States of America, as well as each state\u2019s constitution) that is the sole power of the president (for federal crimes) and each state\u2019s governor (for state crimes).\nThe true essence of the pardon power is about forgiveness, not about releasing the guilty and dangerous -- like murderers and child molesters -- back onto the streets. Organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and The Innocence Project focus much of their work on inmates, many of whom are not sympathetic to the average American.\nThe majority of Americans who seek a pardon have never been to prison, but rather pleaded guilty to a crime and were sentenced to probation. Whether one is sentenced to 5 years in prison or 5 years on probation, both remain convicted felons for life. Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Rodgers, for example, was recently pardoned by Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman for felony larceny he committed in 1970. He never went to prison, but received two years probation.\nIn 2004, Eric Pizer, an Iraq war veteran who served two tours of duty, was arrested in Madison, Wis., and charged with felony battery after he tried to break up a fight just two days after he returned from war. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years probation. He never went to prison.\nFor the past 10 years, Pizer has been a devoted husband and father. He received a Criminal Justice degree. But employers only see his permanent \u201cFelon\u201d Scarlett Letter. He can only get low-paying jobs and currently works as a piano mover.\nWisconsin\u2019s Constitution states, \u201cThe governor shall have power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, after conviction, for all offenses, except treason and cases of impeachment, upon such conditions and with such restrictions and limitations as he may think proper\u2026\u201d Gov. Walker has ignored this executive power: he has yet to grant a single pardon even though his five predecessors granted more than 800 certificates of forgiveness.\nAnother veteran who served three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan was convicted of felony burglary in Illinois for stealing a saddle from a barn when he was 18 years old, prior to his first deployment. Again, he never went to prison but was sentenced to probation.\nNow he is living as a civilian, has a wife and young daughter, and is certified as an EMT. He cannot obtain employment from any municipality as a fireman solely because of his felony conviction. He is currently seeking a pardon from Illinois Gov.

(AP Photo/Anderson Independent-Mail, Mark Crammer) SENECA OUT GREENVILLE NEWS OUT\nAngry atheists are at it again.\nThis week, they\u2019re taking on Dabo Swinney, head coach of the Clemson Tigers. His alleged unlawful conduct? Expressing his Christian faith and allegedly making a number of voluntary religious activities available to his players -- the adult student-athletes at Clemson.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation sent Clemson University a \u201cletter of complaint\u201d detailing Swinney\u2019s alleged constitutional violations, including such atrocities as the team\u2019s volunteer chaplain writing Bible verses on a whiteboard and the team making available bus transportation to players who wish to attend church.\nIn a reasonable constitutional world, this complaint would be ignored by the media and discarded by the university. After all, there\u2019s no evidence that Clemson or Coach Swinney did anything other than expose players to the coach\u2019s religious point of view, a point of view he\u2019s constitutionally entitled to hold and express.\nPlayers were not compelled to attend church or Bible study, and the university is not paying the volunteer chaplain. So, how could any of these actions \u201cestablish\u201d a religion within the meaning of the Establishment Clause.\nWe do not, however, live in a reasonable constitutional world. Because of a quirk in the law, atheists have the power to go to federal court simply because a public acknowledgment of religion offends them. Their mere offense can often give them \u201cstanding\u201d to file a federal lawsuit.\nThus, an atheist\u2019s temper tantrum has real-world power.\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation exercises this power to the fullest, using litigation and threats of litigation to challenge everything from the National Motto (\u201cIn God We Trust\u201d), to war memorials, to even the display of the Star of David at a Holocaust memorial (yes, really).\nThis real-world power is multiplied ten-fold by media complicity. Just look at the Clemson controversy. Within days of FFRF\u2019s press release, news of its latest attack on religious expression raced across the Internet, putting the university under immediate public pressure \u2013 when not one single player had complained about the coaches conduct.\nIn other words, there\u2019s no constitutional violation and no victim, but there is still a national controversy.\nThe combination of potential court action and media pressure unfortunately causes public officials to back down again and again, often before lawsuits are even filed. Fortunately, however, Clemson is backing its coach.\nAnd, so are tens of thousands of Americans. We are sending a letter of support to the Clemson coach and in just 24-hours, more than 50,000 Americans expressed their support for Coach Swinney.\nThe response has to be two-fold. First, confront FFRF and its angry atheist allies in court, fighting their cases not just on the merits but also contesting the very idea that mere personal offense can be sufficient grounds for filing suit. There is reason to believe the Supreme Court of the United States \u2013 when it considers the issue \u2013 will do away with \u201coffended observer\u201d standing, and if it does it will restore constitutional sanity to First Amendment doctrine.\nNext, FFRF must also be confronted in the media. The avalanche of coverage it enjoys can often deceive public officials into believing angry atheists have a high degree of public support. In fact, there are many atheists who have no problem hearing religious viewpoints \u2013 after all, no reasonable person expects to always hear statements they like \u2013 and have no problem with religious liberty.\nIt\u2019s doubtful that the angry atheists at FFRF command majority support even among American Atheists (its membership is only 20,000), much less the millions of American Christians. When public institutions cave to atheist threats, they frequently enrage their constituencies \u2013 not out of legal necessity, but merely to end an unpleasant news cycle.\nAmerican democracy thrives in an atmosphere of freedom, when all Americans enjoy to the fullest their rights to free speech and free exercise of religion. Democracy thrives when we seek not to censor speech we dislike, but instead to change hearts and minds through debate and dialogue.\nThrough quirks in the law, and with the help of a complicit media, angry atheists seek to change the terms of the debate, to narrow the marketplace of ideas to exclude religious voices.\nThey must be opposed. Not silenced, but opposed. Temper tantrums cannot and must not trump the First Amendment.\nJay Sekulow is the Chief Counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ).

They originate from a good teacher who imparted upon us something so simple yet profound that it made an indelible mark on our memory, causing us to never forget it.\nOne of these sparks I recall from law school came from a professor who taught his students how to identify when a tax occurs: \u201cA tax occurs on a transfer of money. Picture a government hand. There are times when a buyer transfers money to a seller, interrupted by the government hand grabbing the money in the middle, taking out its share then handing the balance to the seller.\u201d\nThis definition of a tax occurring only on a transfer of money has served me well because the definition has never failed me.\nA review of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\u2019s definition of tax shows a variety of taxes, all of them first requiring a transfer of money or value: Income tax, payroll tax, consumption tax, estate tax, capital gains tax, gift tax, franchise tax, gross receipts tax, severance tax, tariffs, excise taxes on fuel, liquor and cigarettes, licenses and surcharges all involve obvious transfers of money.\nUser fees tax the transfer to the consumer of that which is being used.\nAd Valorem taxes in manufacturing are levied upon the transfer of a product whose value has been increased.\nEven real estate taxes, a form of ad valorem, occur when realty is transferred (though more insidious than others in that the transfer is then taxed each year, the amount of tax rising and falling with the value of the property which is tied to the transfer of money being gained or lost). Real estate taxes are also user fees assessed for the transfer of benefits like snow removal, garbage removal, etc.\nEvery tax has at its core the prerequisite of a transfer of money or value.\nThanks to the ObamaCare ruling, not transferring money or value may now be taxed, the precise opposite of what a tax has been in the history of jurisprudence.\nThe dissent laments the scant words used by Chief Justice Roberts on the issue, and all that can be found is the following, surely to win this year\u2019s circuitous argument award:\n\u201cSustaining the mandate as a tax depends only on whether Congress has properly exercised its taxing power to encourage purchasing health insurance, not whether it can.\u201d [Emphasis in the original]\nIn other words, Congress did it, therefore we assume they can do it. Can you say, unchecked power?\nWhat is left out of that analysis is what a tax \u201cis.\u201d Let\u2019s break Roberts' argument down. The question of \u201cwhether Congress properly exercised its taxing power\u201d was answered in the affirmative by the Chief Justice based upon nothing more than the collection agent being the IRS. As the Chief Justice said specifically, he is not deciding the issue of whether Congress \u201ccan\u201d do this; he\u2019s merely recognizing they did.\nWhy leave open the issue of whether the Congress \u201ccan\u201d do this? Because that would require defining what a tax \u201cis.\u201d This clearly not being a tax (as Roberts ironically finds in the first part of the decision to avoid the Anti-Injunction Act) the answer would have been that Congress clearly \u201ccannot\u201d do what they did. Roberts\u2019 reasoning can be stated thusly: \u201cCongress did it, therefore it is done.\u201d\nThe most succinct words from the dissent about this is an affirmation that what Congress and the Chief Justice have done has never been done before, centered on this being a penalty not a tax (exactly as the Obama administration contended, and as Roberts found in the beginning of this schizophrenic decision that finds on one issue this is a penalty an on another issue it is a tax):\nWe never have classified as a tax an exaction imposed for violation of the law, and so too, we never have classified as a tax an exaction described in the legislation itself as a penalty.\nWhile the definition of tax and how to identify a tax has now been set upon its head, far more damage has been done to individual liberty.\nCongress may now tax you for not doing what it wants you to do. Somehow, that\u2019s not a penalty so long as the IRS collects the money. It is a tax.\nThe Democrats who constructed this new power suffer from the \u201cGood King\u201d delusion. They see their ends \u2013 universal health care \u2013 as so good that it justifies giving themselves the power to retard liberty and direct individual behavior.\nThe problem, of course, is never with the \u201cGood King,\u201d rather the \u201cNext King.\u201d What sort of behavior will the Next King, the one we don\u2019t know yet, compel us to do with this new power to direct our behavior against our will?\nTommy De Seno is editor of JustifiedRight.com and is a practicing attorney.

Republicans to let Obama own the fiscal crisis\nThis Nov. 16, 2012 file photo shows President Barack Obama, accompanied by House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, speaking to reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, as he hosted a meeting of the bipartisan, bicameral leadership of Congress to discuss the deficit and economy in Washington.AP\nIf you thought the bulk of our gridlocked politics would end in November, think again. The prospect of our country going off what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d has both the right and the left staking out their territory in a battle over how to handle our very unbalanced books.\nPresident Obama and a good chunk of Democrats want to raise taxes on the nation\u2019s highest earners. Though the president says he also wants to have a conversation about reforming entitlements, he hasn\u2019t put any type of proposal on paper. Nor is the president or his party interested in serious spending cuts, aside from cuts to the Department of Defense, something Republicans argue would hurt our national security muscle in a time when we need it the most.\nAt the same time, Republicans have put forth plans to tackle the biggest driver of our debt\u2014entitlements\u2014and even had a presidential ticket that ran on those reforms. The House of Representatives has passed some version of these plans and Speaker John Boehner has adopted a Mitt Romney -- idea to eliminate certain deductions in order to raise revenue to pay down our debt. Raising taxes, however\u2014on anyone\u2014is not an option, they say. Unless one side caves, we\u2019re slated to dive off the so-called \"cliff\" in December.\nSo why don\u2019t Republicans just get out of the way and let it happen? It sounds crazy, but there is a case to be made.\nLet Democrats bring a bill to increase spending on what Obama calls a second stimulus, raise taxes on high earners (including many small businesses) without doing a thing to fix Medicare and Social Security for current and future generations. Republicans can take a page of Obama\u2019s playbook and vote present as he did when he was a senator. When the nation falls off the fiscal cliff, he can own it.\nThe tax increases that happen will be the Obama tax increases. When spending spikes, it can be the Obama tax and spend plan. And we slide into recession as the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts will happen, it will be the Obama recession. In other words, it's time for the right to call Obama's bluff.\nDoing so would only further highlight the Democrats' fiscal cliff irresponsibility, especially that of Obama. He almost quadrupled federal spending to that of President George W. Bush, refused to make any changes to entitlements during the debt ceiling debate and has been pushing for higher taxes for years (even though in 2011 he said raising taxes on anyone in a recession would be a mistake when he extended the Bush tax cuts).\nWhat\u2019s worse? Many who voted for Obama would be disproportionately affected, and low income Americans will be affected the most. According to the Wall Street Journal, \u201ca single unemployed person making less than $10,000 would see his or her taxes rise 55.2%. Loss of benefits for the working poor is a big factor. Many unemployed people also face loss of extended unemployment benefits.\u201d\n\u201cAn average married couple making $20,000 to $30,000 would sees their tax go up $1,423, from receiving a $15 refund to paying $1,408. Big factors include the loss of the Bush-era 10% bracket, the loss of relief from the so-called marriage penalty and reduction of the child credit. Average tax rate under the proposal: 5.5% Average federal tax change: Up $1,423, or 9,809%.\u201d\nCollege students would face an increase of 37.9% and the highest tax increase would hit retirees making around $40,000 at a whopping 42.4%.\nJust this week, Warren Buffet argued that tax rates need to be more progressive. Many people don\u2019t get that the Bush tax cuts already are. They created that beneficial 10% tax bracket for lower middle class earners and took a lot of poor Americans off the tax rolls altogether. The rich are paying more now than ever in taxes because they are making more, despite their rate being slightly lower.\nJust like in Greece, unless people are affected by the gluttonous spending in Washington in a personal way, they are unlikely to wake up and support any kind of real reform. Plus, the economy is likely to correct itself even in a recession. It\u2019s often the actions taken to prevent a recession that can do the most damage rather than letting it happen.\nIf a majority of the country elected Obama to four more years in the White House, then let them have it their way without GOP support.\nPerhaps our nation needs to dive off the cliff in order to realize how dire our debt problem really is. Then maybe they'll support real change.\nPlus, Republicans will get blamed anyway. The president\u2019s current public relations tour across country on the fiscal cliff is designed for that exact purpose. It\u2019s much easier than leading.\nIf as Obama has said, \u201cthe buck stops\u201d with him, then let it. America will soon realize that elections do have consequences.\nAndrea Tantaros is co-host of \u201cThe Five\u201d on Fox News Channel.

Mitt Romney was due to the fact that his principles were unknown, they made a grave mistake.\nWhile the change in course seemed like an unknown, it\u2019s important to be reminded that the vision Romney championed has formed the backbone of America\u2019s economic supremacy for decades. Readers get just such a reminder from Steve Forbes\u2019 latest book, Freedom Manifesto: Why Free Markets are Moral and Big Government Isn\u2019t. In it, Forbes not only makes a compelling case for free-market capitalism, he also shows in gruesome detail just how entrenched government has become in so many sectors of the U.S. economy \u2013 and our daily lives.\nIn fact, a central theme throughout Forbes\u2019 book is the destructive nature of government intervention. Although \"Freedom Manifesto\" takes an expansive view of government policies going back decades, it pays particular attention to recent events. Names like Solyndra, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the auto industry evoke images of squandered taxpayer money and trillion-dollar bailouts. And most of it came because of government\u2019s efforts to pick winners and losers in the marketplace, instead of letting consumer demand driving the success of these entities.\nGovernment is expanding its reach now more than ever. Consider America\u2019s current path to fiscal disaster: a debt exceeding $16 trillion, record amounts of government spending and deficits, and a looming fiscal cliff that further threatens our economic freedom. As Forbes notes, the so-called \u201cmisery index,\u201d which equals the unemployment rate plus the inflation rate, is at it highest level in three decades. America cannot sustain itself on its current path.\nThe sustainability problem becomes even more obvious when looking at our ever-expanding entitlement state. Our entitlement programs are not only breeding government dependence; they are collectively the single biggest factor bankrupting our nation. Forbes cites that 70 percent of federal spending now goes to individual assistance programs and over half of Americans pay no federal income taxes at all. The entitlement state crushes the entrepreneurial spirit, transforming our society from a society that creates, to a society that takes.\nAs Forbes asks: \u201cAren\u2019t people better off developing their talents and learning how to help themselves rather than being trapped in dependency on government?\u201d\nSo what can uplift and mobilize Americans \u2013 from the CEO to the entrepreneur to the assembly line mechanic -- from our current economic downturn? We need to pursue policies that champion risk, freedom and innovation. In other words, as Forbes writes, \u201cFree markets enable people to channel their creative energies into meeting the wants and needs of others, improving living standards and making life better by turning scarcity into abundance.\u201d When the market is left to its own devices and government gets out of the way, individuals create jobs and wealth.\nOur entitlement programs are not only breeding government dependence; they are collectively the single biggest factor bankrupting our nation.\n-\nBut today we are seeing the direct opposite of that free society. Government is expanding its reach into nearly every sector of our lives, from health care to the type of energy we consume to the way we run our businesses.\nWhere has this gotten us?\nOur country is experiencing the longest recession since the Great Depression. President Obama often reminds us that he inherited a big mess \u2013 and he did. Because of this, our expectations have never been unreasonable.\nAs \"Freedom Manifesto\" makes clear even through its chapter titles \u2013 \u201cFedEx or The Post Office?\u201d \u201cSilicon Valley or Detroit?\u201d \u201cApple or Solyndra?\u201d \u2013 this election really came down to what kind of society we want to be. Do we want an America that grants government the power to control our lives, or an America that champions individualism, innovation and liberty?\nWe missed an opportunity to correct our course in 2012. I can only hope more people will have read \"Freedom Manifesto\" by the next election.", "\nThe 'forgotten Americans' are engaged and the GOP must not fail them again\nA sign directing voters is posted along a fence line at the Platte County Fair Grounds in Tracy, Mo., Tuesday, March 15, 2016. Voters in Missouri, as well as North Carolina, Illinois, Ohio and Florida are casting their ballots in primary elections Tuesday. (AP Photo/Orlin Wagner)\nOne thing is for sure this 2016 presidential race, the \u201csilent majority\u201d is no longer silent, and everybody knows it. But who are these people? Before President Richard Nixon called them the \u201csilent majority,\u201d he called them the \u201cforgotten Americans.\u201d\nThe forgotten Americans love their families and want a better life for their kids. The forgotten Americans work hard\u2014they weren\u2019t born on 3rd base and thought they hit a triple. They worship their God and they go to church. They pay their taxes and obey the law.\nThe forgotten Americans believe in American exceptionalism. When America\u2019s security is threatened, they are always the first to volunteer to defend her. They understand and appreciate the sacrifices their forefathers made to give them a land of opportunity and freedom. And they respect and appreciate those in the military and in law enforcement who put on the uniform everyday to protect those freedoms and keep us safe.\nYes, the forgotten Americans love their country, but today believe their government and its leaders have let them down. They see Judeo-Christian values under attack. They are concerned about the erosion of the freedoms they cherish. They worry about America\u2019s economy and each has a family member or knows someone who has looked so long for a job that our government doesn\u2019t even consider them unemployed anymore.\nThey see the rise of radical Islam and the real threat it poses to their way of life. Yet, the forgotten Americans don\u2019t understand it when their President refuses to utter the phrase \u201cradical Islamic Terrorism.\u201d\nThey want to see America\u2019s borders secured. However, the forgotten Americans don\u2019t understand why our government, under both a Republican and a Democrat President, would not fund and enforce the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was the law of the land and would have helped keep illegal aliens and radical Islamists from crossing our borders.\nTheir kids are being taught, in the schools they fund, more about \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d than American history. And as the events of Chicago sadly reminded us, the political correctness they\u2019re being taught is one that says only your constitutional rights matter, not those of your fellow countrymen.\nSomething is wrong and the forgotten Americans know it. They see the America they love slipping away and they worry about their children\u2019s future in an America with less freedom and less opportunity.\nThe forgotten Americans really aren\u2019t \u201cpolitical\u201d and often times aren\u2019t involved in the process. In fact, in 2012 some 90 million eligible Americans didn\u2019t vote. The forgotten Americans made the difference for Richard Nixon in 1968, propelled Ronald Reagan to victory in 1980, and gave George W. Bush his 3 million vote margin in 2004.\nYes, every so often, the forgotten Americans see their country and its values under siege and their way of life threatened and they always come home. Today, they are \u201ccoming home\u201d and voting in record turnouts. They are voting in unheard of numbers in the Republican Presidential primaries even though they believe the GOP has failed them time and time again.\nThe forgotten Americans are giving the GOP one more chance to get it right. Republican leaders must hear their voices, embrace them and not fail them this time.\nMany in the establishment don\u2019t know what to make of the forgotten Americans. The truth is that the forgotten Americans are our most loyal and dedicated citizens when clouds appear on America\u2019s horizon. They have always answered America\u2019s call, whether at Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, Normandy or fighting radical Islamic terrorism. They are exactly the kind of people you want in your foxhole when the firefight begins. They must be welcomed by the GOP, including the establishment and elites. They will probably be, yet again, the ones who save this country and keep America safe, secure, prosperous and a land of opportunity for all Americans.", "\nChristians must be represented (and protected) in Syrian peace talks\nSyrian peace talks have resumed this week in Geneva. In Washington, the House of Representatives has unanimously approved a resolution declaring the Islamic State to have perpetrated genocide on Christians and other religious minorities in Syria and Iraq.\nIn Moscow, Vladimir Putin has announced the partial withdrawal of Russian combat forces from Syria. This is a time of promise for a region accustomed to despair.\nRussia\u2019s reduction of combat capabilities is particularly significant for the Geneva peace talks, giving Syrian President Bashar Assad encouragement to negotiate toward a transition regime, knowing Russian support will not be available in perpetuity (Putin avoiding America\u2019s Vietnam and Russia\u2019s Afghanistan debacles).\nParticipating in the Geneva talks, sponsored by the United Nations, are representatives of the Assad government and of the non-extremist elements of the anti-Assad opposition. These talks are intended not only concretize the cease-fire currently in place, but also to draft a new constitution and to implement national elections next year. In short, to create a new Syria.\nNo people have more at stake in the outcome of these peace talks than the one million Christians remaining in that country. Christians, along with other religious minorities, will be the most vulnerable to a bad outcome of the Geneva negotiations. Failure to put in place a pluralistic government of national unity with durable guarantees for the safety of religious minorities will mean a Syria from which Christians are simply eradicated \u2013 either killed or expelled.\nAnd yet, Christians are unrepresented in the talks. There is no party to the negotiations which can speak on behalf of the interests of the Christians. Why? Because Christians are not belligerents in the civil war; they are neither government nor opposition. Christians are being excluded from the peace talks because they aren\u2019t trying to kill anyone.\nThis is why we have delivered to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, a petition signed by 37,500 concerned citizens of many nations, bringing to the attention of United Nations officials the dangers faced by Syria's remaining Christians, and the need for their representation in Geneva.\nThe reason for the precariousness of the Christian situation in Syria is simple: there is no opposition group fighting the Assad regime which, if in power, would tolerate the presence of Christians and respect their rights to live in peace and practice their faith. Even the opposition groups backed by the United States have shown a reckless disregard for the safety and dignity of Christians. Just look at the photographs of the desolate Christian neighborhood of old Homs, gratuitously razed by the retreating Free Syrian Army two years ago. One bishop told us, \u201cThe difference between moderates and extremists is that extremists will kill you and take your house; the moderates will take your house, but let you live.\u201d\nUnfavorable outcomes of the peace talks from the Christian perspective include either a government dominated by unmoderated opposition forces intolerant of religious minorities, or a government too weak to defend itself from the extremist opposition forces of the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State, neither of which are party to the talks. The extremists have been excluded from the current negotiations \u2013 but that does not mean they won\u2019t continue to seek control of the nation.\nEvents in world have forced the great nations to seek with some urgency a resolution of the Syrian civil war. It began in March 2011; it has killed 250,000, driven 4.4 million out of the country, and made homeless another 6.6 million within Syria. The Christian population of Syria before the war was roughly two million, now half that number.\nThe richness of Syrian Christianity will make it difficult for Christians to be represented with one voice. The Christian Church in Syria is principally administered by the five Patriarchs of Antioch, successors of Saints Peter and Paul. These five patriarchs lead the Greek-Orthodox Church of Antioch, the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Maronite Catholic Church, and the Syriac Catholic Church (the latter three are in communion with Rome). Other Christian churches with a significant presence in Syria are: the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Armenian Catholic Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, and the Union of Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East.\nBut if Saudi Arabia was able to bring 100 opposition figures together in Riyadh late last year to agree on the structure of their representation at the talks, then the same can be accomplished by the disparate Christian communities. Diversity must not be an excuse to deny Christians their voice in designing tomorrow\u2019s Syria.\nSteve Wagner is president of Solidarity with the Persecuted Church a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit which provides assistance to the Christian Church where she faces persecution.", "\nBrian Jenkins: Could ISIS and Al Qaeda, two giants of jihad, unite?\nThere are both similarities and differences between Al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Both are bloodthirsty terrorist organizations bent on jihad, sworn enemies of the infidel West and the United States in particular. Could they one day unite in an international jihadist merger to create an even more potent regional and global threat? It is possible.\nFor the moment, at least, the two groups are rivals for the mantle of jihadi supremacy and neither side\u2019s leadership has shown much interest in a union. The situation is extremely fluid, though, so it is not inconceivable that at some point in the future, beyond the current leadership perhaps, the two organizations could become one.\nAl Qaeda has morphed several times since its emergence in the 1990s and its recognition as the global leader in terror with the 9/11 attacks in 2001.\nISIL or ISIS did not emerge as an international rival to Al Qaeda until 2013. Since then, ISIS challenged Al Qaeda\u2019s central leadership, engaged in hostilities with Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, expanded its areas of control and influence in Syria and Iraq, declared the existence of an Islamic State, and received pledges of loyalty from various jihadist fronts, including factions within Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliates in Africa and the Middle East.\nThough they are rivals, there are many similarities between the two groups. Both enterprises comprise a central leadership and an array of affiliates who, while pledging their loyalty to one or the other, have their own interests, capabilities, and modus operandi. Individual fighters may also have their own agendas, and loyalties may continue to shift according to which group is perceived as dominant. In addition, both organizations appeal to self-radicalized individuals, who help the groups build their respective brands through terrorist acts carried out in other regions, including in the United States.\nIn terms of their worldview and ideology, the two enterprises are close. Both see Islam under threat by hostile forces primarily in the West. They share a fundamentalist or Salafist interpretation of the faith. They share the same notion that jihad means primarily an armed struggle, not merely a spiritual quest, and that it is the collective and individual duty of all Muslims to participate in or directly contribute to the armed struggle. Both Al Qaeda and ISIS see themselves as global movements with global ambitions. Both reject the tenets of the current international order and see the conflict between Muslims and \u201ccrusaders\u201d as one that began centuries ago and that will continue to Judgment Day.\nStill, there are some doctrinal differences. Al Qaeda\u2019s leaders (and most Muslim scholars) reject ISIS\u2019s declaration of the caliphate. ISIS takes a harder line on Shia, focusing a large share of its attacks on Shia mosques and other targets. Al Qaeda has taken a more ecumenical line, arguing that Muslim attacks on Muslims, even those following what it regarded as deviant paths, would alienate followers and distract from the campaign against the infidels.\nWhile Al Qaeda\u2019s leaders have expressed territorial ambitions, like driving Westerners out of Saudi Arabia and ridding Palestine of crusaders and Zionists, the group has largely operated out of sanctuaries, rather than seeking to seize and hold territory.\nISIS\u2019s leaders, on the other hand, see themselves as presiding over an Islamic State, which, as its name implies, is a physical, territorial expression. ISIS conquers, controls, governs, and even runs an economy, something Al Qaeda did not try to do.\nThe duel for supremacy is really a competition for support, alliances with like-minded groups and the loyalty of fighters, both in the region and afar. ISIS appears to be attracting a larger and younger audience, which reflects its superior use of online resources. Part of ISIS\u2019s recruiting appeal also lies in its advertisement of atrocities, but there are weaknesses in this, including a faddish quality, which fickle youth might quickly abandon.\nAl Qaeda, meanwhile, has been less able to receive new fighters in great numbers since its training camps were dispersed after 9/11. Geographic convenience and ease of access enabled ISIS to attract an estimated 30,000 foreign fighters to its ranks, including 5,000 from Western countries. Sill, Al Qaeda has hardly given up its global terrorist campaign, continuing to provide encouragement, training and assistance to foreign volunteers planning to carry out terrorist attacks.\nTo maintain the allegiance of their followers, both Al Qaeda and ISIS must remain violent and active. Terrorists attacking in their home countries have pledged allegiance to both groups.\nThe November terrorist attack on a Paris night club appears to be the work of a group of French fighters serving with ISIS. The attack on the offices of the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January, 2015, was carried out by brothers who had declared their loyalty to Al Qaeda, while their comrade who simultaneously attacked a Kosher supermarket in Paris, claimed his operation to be on behalf of ISIS.\nSyed Farouk, who attacked the San Bernardino Regional Center in December, began plotting terrorist attacks in 2011, well before the emergence of ISIS. However, his wife Tashfeen Malik, who participated in the attack, declared her loyalty to ISIS.\nWhile Al Qaeda and ISIS clearly have a lot in common, there are serious differences standing in the way of an early merger between the two giants of jihad. It could take a change in leadership of both groups and perhaps some compromises on mission and strategy, but there are enough points of confluence to make a united jihadist front a realistic and frightening possibility.", "\nRepublicans are right: The People must have a voice in choosing next Supreme Court Justice\nThe U.S. Supreme Court building seen in Washington.\n(REUTERS/Molly Riley)\nDemocrats seem intent on trying to make the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s vacant seat on the Supreme Court a political issue to use against Republicans. What they really should do is join with Republicans in agreement with the position they, themselves have taken in the past: let the people decide the next justice with their votes for the next president \u2013 no matter who wins.\nThe American people deserve to have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice but President Obama and his liberal allies in Congress want to deny the public that voice.\nWe have a deeply divided country, voter anger is running high in both parties because of the growing sense that Washington politicians simply ignore the voice of the people.\nRepublicans, who deserve their share of the blame in stoking this anxiety, have at least recognized this is an opportunity to empower voters, while President Obama wants to deny them any say, any impact on this crucial issue.\nLet there be no illusions as to whether or not Mr. Schumer, the Democratic Leader Harry Reid, or any other Democrat for that matter would have even contemplated hearings for an individual put forward for nomination by President Bush.\nLest we forget, two members of that same Democratic Senate majority were in the midst of a hotly contested race for the White House, both poised to make history with a victory.\nDoes anyone think for a second that Senators Reid and Schumer would\u2019ve done anything to deny either Barack Obama, as the first African-American president, or Hillary Clinton, as the first woman president, the opportunity to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurred during President Bush\u2019s final year in office? As Martin Luther King would say, the lips of these Senators today now drip with hypocrisy.\nPresident Obama has already placed two extremely liberal justices on the court, he will no doubt select someone who would ensure liberal domination of the court for the next generation.\nAs of now, the court is one vote away from restricting or eliminating Second Amendment rights, one vote away from allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to run amok, one vote away from further restricting or eliminating religious freedom altogether, one vote away from legalizing Partial Birth Abortion, one vote away from giving the IRS free rein to persecute innocent Americans for political purposes.\nThis is why Republicans such as Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others are right -- and should be strongly supported -- in their efforts to give the public a voice.\nLet the people decide the next justice with their votes for the next president \u2013 whoever it is.

It was just 9 minutes start to finish. No one ever boos a short speech.\nThe anticipation of the speech exceeded the performance. At first, the networks didn't want to give the president the time. They objected to cutting into their high quality nightly editions of \"reality stars\" competing against each other or some other silly thing they try to pass off as entertainment these days. They said they wouldn't clear the time unless it was \"news.\" They forgot that airtime is free and controlled by the Federal Communications Commission, and how would they like to have their shows be measured by whether they were entertaining or newsworthy?\nBack to the speech. There was nothing new in the speech -- but reminding the American public what a mess the border situation is was at least a worthwhile effort.

As I said above, he may not want to though.\nThe \"Chuck and Nancy show\" was a visual diaster and certainly didn't provide the gravitas they thought they deserved. It was the same old talking points and both of them looked tired and bored. Their performance was for the elected Democrats who usually work in the Capitol and the buildings in and around it.\nOne day one of those buildings will be named after Speaker Pelosi, like the other three House buildings that are named after three men who were also Speakers -- Cannon, Longworth and Rayburn, all dead long ago.\nI hope Nancy gets hers while still here and presiding. They will have to build another building to do that, but don't worry, the Democrats can always spend taxpayers' money for more offices and staff. None for border security though.\nTrump came to power with his own buildings named after him, including the fanciest and most expensive hotel in D.C., the Trump International Hotel. Technically, the U.S. government owns it and the Trump Organization gets to lease and operate it until long after we've all left this Earth. Trump's name is more valuable than the GSA (Government Services Administration) International Hotel.\nSorry Chuck. There will be no buildings named after you. Maybe a New York bridge or tunnel across the Hudson if you can get President Trump to fund one for you.\nGoing back to the \"Chuck and Nancy show,\" the power twosome would work better as single acts. She had her best day, the day she got sworn in for her second tour as speaker, last week. Now she has to run a House with the most divergent and inexperienced group in history.\nChuck is the minority leader and may hold that title for life.\nThe missing man on Tuesday night was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He is now the most powerful man in D.C. other than the president. The fact that he was missing shows he may also be one of the smartest. Who needed to a part of this extravaganza?\nSomeone asked me why Chuck and Nancy didn't thave two podiums -- why they stood behind a podium made for one? I answered saying they can have anything they want. The Capitol is their building. One half is all in her control, and Mitch McConnell will let Chuck sit or stand anywhere he wants. He might not let him get his bills on the floor of the Senate for a vote though, and that really was what the show was about.\nUsually, or actually always, the president gets to make his speeches (except for State of the Unions) without a TV rebuttal from the other side.\nThe rebuttal went like this: We don't like your wall, it's immoral, and we don't like your statistics. Lies, lies, lies. They also said: Open up the government and we will deal with the border issues later and we promise you'll get a fair hearing. That again is on the wall, which Democrats say we don't want and won't spend a penny on and it's also immoral.\nThe president, on the other hand, is reminded of two former Republican presidents. The first being Ronald Reagan who signed a bill giving amnesty in 1986 to millions with the promise of additional border security later. The later never came. The second president was the recently deceased George H.W. Bush who promised \"no new taxes\" when running in 1988. He broke that promise and 27 percent of Republicans (his base) didn't vote for his reelection.\nRonald Reagan got 59 percent of the vote in 1984 in his reelction bid. President Bush got 37 percent when he tried to get reelected in 1992.\nEd Rollins joined Fox News Channel as a contributor in 2011. Throughout his career, Rollins has served in the administrations of and advised, four United States Presidents. He was the Assistant to the President in charge of the White House Office of Political Affairs and the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and deputy chief of staff during the Reagan administration.", "\nTucker Carlson: Democrats feel illegal immigrants who ignore our laws are more American than you are\nOne thing to know about our national media: If Democratic leaders are saying it, reporters are saying it too.\nIn a televised address to the country Tuesday night, the president made his case for why America needs a wall on our southern border, and why that wall is so important that it\u2019s worth shutting down the federal government to get it. Democrats remained unmoved. Their leaders in Congress on the Democratic side, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, delivered the party\u2019s initial response.\nTheir words were then echoed with mechanical precision by Democrats up and down the chain, from sitting members of Congress, all the way down to the left-wing lady muttering in your local dog park. \u201cTalking points\u201d doesn\u2019t do justice to the rhetorical discipline here. It was like watching a 3-D printer at work, churning out carbon copies of stilted propaganda, one after the other, after the other -- a miracle of replication. You might even call the Democratic response, \u201cmanufactured.\u201d\n\"This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\nSo, the Democrats have brought back \"manufacturing.\"\nOne thing to know about our national media: if Democratic leaders are saying it, reporters are saying it, too. No matter what it is. You often hear conservatives complain that our media are \u201cliberal.\u201d That\u2019s giving them far too much credit. What they really are is obedient, like Shih Tzus begging for a snack. If Nancy Pelosi called for invading Canada tomorrow, all the news anchors would be telling you how Ottawa is the real threat. They\u2019re flunkies, humorless little functionaries doing their sad little jobs. They\u2019re so dumb. They have no self-respect.\nOK, we showed you the mindless lies they\u2019re telling you. What are Democrats actually proposing as an alternative to the border wall? We can answer that with some authority because on January 3, House Democrats passed their own proposal that they say would secure the southern border.\nWhat would it do? Nothing that isn\u2019t being done already. The Democratic bill provides the same funding for partial fencing, border security technology, hiring more customs officers, and so forth, that we already have. In other words, the Democratic \u201cborder security plan\u201d is the status quo. Their argument is that things work fine right now. Instead of spending another dollar to secure our border, Democrats in Congress have just proposed spending $12 million to investigate reparations for slavery, just to give you a portion of a sense of their priorities.\nTo Democrats, everything is more important than border security. That would be fine if our current security was working. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s likely that more 20 million people are already living in our country illegally right now. That\u2019s more than two-and-a half times the entire population of New York City. The actual number may be bigger. We don\u2019t really know -- and that's the point. It\u2019s totally out of control.\nDemocrats feel good about letting in poor people from around the world. These are people who don\u2019t make a lot of complicated demands about health care, dental or unfunded pensions or what their kids should be doing for a living. They\u2019re not whiny, like Americans. They\u2019re not living reminders of how politicians have failed to fulfill their promises. No. They\u2019re just grateful to be here. They\u2019re immigrants. Democrats love people like that. In fact, they\u2019ve come to love them much more than they love you.\nThe problem isn\u2019t that the Border Patrol doesn\u2019t have the right technology. The problem is that our politicians don\u2019t care to fix it. If they did, they could solve the problem in an afternoon. Borders are not complex. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to cure pancreatic cancer here. \"Our best minds are stumped.\" Hardly.\nWhat worked for Hadrian will work for us. It works for Israel right now, and a lot of other places. Walls work. That\u2019s why people still build them. Everybody knows that. This is all a charade. We should at least admit what\u2019s happening.\nWhat you saw Tuesday night wasn\u2019t two parties bickering over the best way to solve a shared problem. No. In this case, one side\u2019s problem is the other\u2019s side\u2019s solution.\nFor Democrats, a porous border is a good thing. An unalloyed good thing. It means more low-wage workers for their donors -- that\u2019s deeply appreciated. It means more compliant voters for them to replace the millions of actual Americans they\u2019ve alienated.\nAnd then there\u2019s the emotional payoff of. Democrats feel good about letting in poor people from around the world. These are people who don\u2019t make a lot of complicated demands about health care, dental or unfunded pensions or what their kids should be doing for a living. They\u2019re not whiny, like Americans. They\u2019re not living reminders of how politicians have failed to fulfill their promises. No. They\u2019re just grateful to be here. They\u2019re immigrants.\nDemocrats love people like that. In fact, they\u2019ve come to love them much more than they love you. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said that out loud Tuesday night:\n\"The women and children on the border that are trying to seek refuge and seek opportunity in the United States of America with nothing but the shirt on their backs are acting more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be,\" she said.\nSo, people who show up here and ignore our laws are more American than you are. That\u2019s how Democrats feel. Keep that in mind as you watch this debate.\nAdapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on January 9, 2019.", "\nLiberal women go into hysterics attacking Sarah Sanders, but they don't speak for most women\nFox411: On her Netflix talk show, Chelsea Handler slammed White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders calling her a 'harlot' and a 'trollop.'\nThe days of ultra-liberal feminists in the media and Hollywood brainwashing women into believing they speak for the majority of us are coming to an abrupt and final end.\nConservative women have increasingly risen to more prominent positions with larger platforms and louder microphones, making it harder for their voices to be drowned out by the shrieks of the extreme liberal women.\nMSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski erupted in hysterics on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Tuesday, demanding all women who work in the White House \u2013 including the President Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka \u2013 turn their backs on the president over a tweet he sent in response to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., calling on him to resign over allegations of sexual misconduct. The president fired back saying that Gillibrand would do anything for campaign contributions.\nSome people accused the president of making a sexual connotation about Gillibrand\u2019s behavior with his tweet. The White House said there was no sexual connotation and said that Gillibrand is not unlike many politicians in Washington, and is an example of a broken system that can be bought off.\nBrzezinski went on to say that women in the White House \u201cdon\u2019t care about this country\u201d and are \u201cworth nothing\u201d unless the president deletes his tweet. She also singled out White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, saying that if Sanders defended the president at the Tuesday press briefing \u2013 in other words, if she did her job \u2013 she should resign.\nBrzezinski\u2019s outbursts are just the latest evidence we\u2019ve seen that as more conservative women rise, far-left women are becoming more and more unhinged and hateful. They are terrified because their jig is up \u2013 and they know it.\nThis was also the case when comedian Chelsea Handler unleashed her middle school mean girl on Sanders last week. Handler viciously mocked Sanders\u2019 appearance in a promotional video for Handler\u2019s Netflix show. She justified it by saying that Sanders deserves to be taken down because she\u2019s \u201cpure evil.\u201d\nPure evil? Wow. When I think of pure evil, I think of Osama bin Laden, Adolf Hitler or Charles Manson \u2013 not a female White House press secretary who defends the president of the United States.\nNobody can say those safe spaces aren\u2019t doing their job.\nAs intelligent adult women, we conservatives watched Handler\u2019s video and felt like we were watching an episode of one of those catty tween shows \u2013 the kind I never let my kids watch. It\u2019s like we were transported back to the superficial world of junior high, where appearance and body image are the biggest problems in the world.\nNote to Handler: You\u2019re no longer in 8th grade. Most of us have graduated from the superficial to the real world and you should too. The issues we\u2019re tackling now are much bigger than makeup.\nPart of being a grownup is being able to disagree by having an intelligent conversation using facts. However, as we\u2019ve seen, when the facts get in the way of all the fiction liberal feminists try to peddle, they take their fight back to the playground.\nFor far too long, conservative women leaders have flown under the radar, but now we have a White House full of strong conservative women. The ultra-liberal feminists are absolutely losing their marbles over it.\nThe far-left women are scared to death and want the cat put back in the bag, so to speak. There is a president who was supposed to be anti-woman in the Oval Office, but the West Wing \u2013 specifically the Press Office \u2013 is stacked with women in high-powered positions who speak on behalf of his administration every day.\nEchoes of feminist hissy fits from the likes of Brzezinski and Handler are being heard all over the place at the threat of losing their claim to the XX chromosome. And I\u2019m sure we haven\u2019t heard the last of them yet.\nIn Michelle Obama\u2019s speech at the Democratic National Convention, she famously said that \u201cwhen they go low, we go high.\u201d Handler and Brzezinski certainly haven\u2019t taken that advice.\nConservative women are finally realizing we are not alone. Women who were once afraid to speak up because they always assumed they were in the minority are now finding their voice and discovering there are more women out there like them than they ever realized.\nUltra-liberal feminists are in full-on panic mode. However, watching the extreme attacks that people like Mika Brzezinski and Chelsea Handler pull doesn\u2019t help their cause with women outside of their bubble.\nOut here in the rest of the world, where real women live, most of us find tactics like the assaults on Sanders to be vile and disgusting.", "\nOn 'Special Report,' House Homeland Security Committee chairman discusses the New York City terror attack.\nToday\u2019s terror attack in New York City is another reminder that the threats we face from Islamist terrorists are real and can bring serious harm to our homeland.\nThanks to American leadership and a new strategy on the battlefield, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi was able to declare that ISIS has been defeated in Iraq. While this is welcome news, crushing the so-called \u2018caliphate\u2019 in the Middle East, allows foreign fighters and sympathizers of ISIS and Al Qaeda to scatter.\nThey are returning to their home countries, looking for different ways to keep their hateful ideology alive and creating new dangers in other parts of the world. This has brought a new wave of terror attacks to the West.\nEuropean cities once known for their culture and history, are becoming well known for deadly attacks. They include London, Brussels, Paris, Nice, Barcelona and Berlin. And the bombing at the Port Authority this morning is already the second attack in New York in under two months.\nAs Americans, we cannot forget that we are in this fight together. Terrorists do not check our political affiliations before they carry out an attack.\n- House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul\nIslamist extremists are clearly answering the call of Sheik Adnani to kill Westerners using whatever means necessary wherever they are. Since our enemies our constantly adjusting their tactics, we must remain agile in defense of our nation.\nTo defeat these threats, we need to work with tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to take down radical propaganda that preaches hate and recruits new members to the terrorist cause. The advancement of technology has brought great benefits, but is has also been a powerful tool for our adversaries. The internet been a constant lifeline, allowing them to effectively plot and communicate at lightning speed.\nWe must also bolster the security of our airports with the most advanced screening technology available. Even though many of the attacks in the last year have been vehicular homicides, our aviation sector is still the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of targets.\nLastly, the U.S. must continue to lead an international alliance dedicated to using all of its economic, intelligence, military, and other resources to dry up funding for terrorists and destroy them on the battlefield.\nAs Americans, we cannot forget that we are in this fight together. Terrorists do not check our political affiliations before they carry out an attack. We will have political differences on many issues, but our commitment to keeping our homeland safe and secure should be a national priority for everyone.\nWe cannot allow the cowardly acts of terrorists to shake our will or dent our morale. With sound policies and innovative approaches to homeland security and by staying united and maintaining our resolve, we will defeat this evil enemy once and for all.\nRepublican Michael McCaul, represents Texas' 10th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He serves as chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.", "\nBut America\u2019s woes in Asia don\u2019t stop with North Korea. In fact, the challenge Washington faces in that vital part of the world are much bigger. The good news is that the Trump Administration does have a narrow window to do something about it\u2014before it's too late.\nNow is the time for Washington to end the era of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d with another rogue regime, one that is not only aiding North Korea\u2019s military rise but is also on a crash course to dominate the Asia-Pacific.\nThat country is none other than the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nTo be fair, the challenge China has posed to U.S. national security always seems to be get placed on the backburner, to be dealt with another day\u2014something both Democrat and Republican administrations are guilty of.\nThe reasons are obvious. Years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, a great recession like no other, a Syrian civil war that seems never ending, tensions with Russia and now an epic struggle to ensure ISIS is simply no more have all ensured Beijing gets a pass for its actions -- time and time again.\nAs Washington cast its focus everywhere else, China has decided to shed the notion of a so-called \u201cpeaceful rise,\" and instead pursue a dangerous course of action that is only leading to rising tensions with America, and if successful, will turn Asia into Beijing\u2019s own private sphere of influence.\nHow China has worked to achieve its goals is clear, and in fact, is very much out in the open.\nFirst, Beijing has done all it can to create an arc of instability, from the East China Sea all the way to the very ends of the South China Sea to advance its agenda. China prods and pushes its claims of \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d in all directions along this track, using civilian ships like fishing vessels, a dangerous maritime militia, and coast guard vessels that are many times nothing more than redesigned Chinese naval vessels, to ensure its mastery of the seas around them. Its goal is to turn such vital waterways into extensions of its territory, or what it calls \u201cblue national soil.\"\nIndeed, Beijing\u2019s actions in the hotly disputed South China Sea deserve special attention. The beating heart of Asia\u2019s economic miracle, China has literally drawn borders around this critical part of the global ocean commons. Called the nine-dash-line, China has done what no other nation has dared to do in centuries: place outlandish claims over vast waterways, that if enforced, would destroy the notion that oceans and seas can be claimed by no one. Beijing has even gone so far as to build island military bases out of small rocks and reefs in the area, tipping the strategic balance in its favor.\nNext, to ensure the region takes China\u2019s claims seriously, Beijing\u2019s military might has advanced by leaps and bounds. Experts inside the Pentagon have privately told me that they fear America may now lack the ability to protect its interests and allies against China if conflict did break out\u2014unless Washington was willing to accept casualties not seen since the Vietnam War, or worse.\nBeijing\u2019s strategy to dominate Washington in a conflict is also quite clear. Knowing that it still can\u2019t match America ship for ship or plane for plane, Beijing has developed countless classes of deadly missiles. In the event of a conflict over Taiwan, the South or East China Seas or in Korea, China would shower U.S. bases, warships or allies with potentially thousands of missiles. And worst of all, thanks to treaty commitments agreed to with the now defunct Soviet Union, Washington is unable to legally build land-based missiles in the ranges needed to respond in kind.\nBut for Beijing this is simply not enough. China has even decided that it must begin to match America in as many possible areas of traditional military might as possible. Through cyber espionage, it has stolen classified data involving some of America\u2019s most advanced military platforms. Such theft has included data on the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters, the THAAD missile defense system and many others. Take a look at China\u2019s latest stealth fighter, the J-20. See a resemblance to America\u2019s stealth weapons? The reason is obvious.\nFor Washington and its allies, the accumulation of Chinese economic, military and diplomatic muscle means the international community can no longer ignore this threat.\nConsidering all of this, now is the time for America to push back against Chinese acts of aggression\u2014and not through failed foreign policy slogans like a \u201cpivot\u201d or \u201crebalance\u201d\u2014but through actual deeds.\nThe Trump administration must develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure that Beijing does not dominate the Asia-Pacific, bully our allies or partners in region, or is able to defeat Washington in a military conflict.\nLet there be no doubt, the growing threat of a nuclear North Korea compounded with the rise of China and its aggressive acts to ensure it dominates Asia are the two biggest foreign policy challenge America faces today. There can be only one response: when it comes to Trump\u2019s foreign policy strategy, \u201cAmerica First\u201d must mean Asia is the top priority above all else.\nIt's well past time that Washington make \u2018Asia First\u2019 a slogan it will put steel behind. There simply is no other choice.", "\nDefending your beliefs in an aggressive culture\nFor months, we\u2019ve been watching it happen: good people we thought we knew having virtual smackdowns online as we sit ringside.\nIn some cases, we\u2019ve thrown ourselves in the ring and lived to regret its emotional toll.\nWhat once seemed like harmless banter over differing beliefs has hit fever pitch as of late -- political mindsets and social viewpoints turning violent, as in the recent shooting of Representative Steve Scalise and his colleagues during a typically friendly baseball practice.\nIt\u2019s hard not to have anxiety over our growing vitriolic culture.\nThe internet can be a hard place for beliefs, same as the cubicle in the office, despite the welcoming smile of the succulent and cozy bedazzled cup holder made by the co-worker\u2019s kid.\nEven those of us with the strongest faith have found ourselves cowering in the midst of a stormy culture, fearful that to out our true convictions is to call attention to ourselves to our detriment. We have enough problems without adding interpersonal turmoil to the list, thank you very much.\nSo we sit with our angst, bury our beliefs, and feel good about none of it.\nThe answer is not to cower, cave or go on the attack, but to have a better strategy for rational and respectable response to difficult issues.\nIn every situation, the goal can\u2019t be for people to agree with us. If that is our objective, welcome to a life of futility and endless pursuit.\nBut if we truly want to be able to stand and respond to an aggressive culture that will often be at odds with our faith and core beliefs, we must choose a better way. Become a steady, wise voice that people come to count on for strength despite the craziness of this world.\nIn other words: look different from most everyone else.\n1) Know what you believe. The truth is, many of us have opinions and strong words. But far fewer actually know what we believe. There is a vast difference between knowing what we believe, being grounded in our convictions after prayerful, careful consideration, practice and thought and grabbing onto someone else\u2019s life research. Listen and gather information. Consider opinions and thoughts. But at the end of the day, ground yourself in something more than that. Do your own work. Make this a personal quest. Pray and read the Bible. Build your life on more than passing trends, cultural fads and bandwagon beliefs. When you know what you believe you will be able to defend your beliefs in an aggressive culture, even when it doesn\u2019t believe as you do. (I would add: the way you defend your beliefs is key, as well. Practice humility and ask God for wisdom as you speak out in defense of what you believe.)\n2) Tell the truth. At first glance, this may seem like an odd way to defend your beliefs, but it\u2019s really the key to any successful important conversation. In fact, it is the key to life, the key to everything because truth is the only way to live. We have to be honest with ourselves, first and foremost, before we ever try to be a truthteller to someone else. (Where we struggle, where we need help \u2013 which is often a step we bypass.) When we defend our beliefs with truth on our side, we come into the equation with strength. Defending our faith, what we believe, is best accomplished from a posture of personal freedom, and freedom only comes from a life of complete truth. When we tell others the truth, we do so from a place of steadied conviction, but also with the understanding that the belief may not be shared so kindness and respect is a human non-negotiable. When this piece is missing, not even the most intelligent voice will be heard.\n3) Steady yourself. People are looking for a steady, positive voice in the ever-increasing combativeness of culture. While we reject inconsistency and antagonism, we appreciate honest dialogue driven by stability and kindness as a human non-negotiable. We don\u2019t have to give up beliefs or personal convictions in order to engage in considerate debate. A person who has grounded themselves in their faith and their commitment to treating others with respect, even in the face of differing opinion, is a person who will find themselves having influence without making harsh demands.\nThe world will continue in its varying commentary and controversy over differing opinions and belief will remain a cultural norm.\nWe can rise above the aggression and anger and let our voices be heard: about the things we hold most dear, convictions that drive our life, and faith that is our bedrock.\nLet\u2019s know what we believe, tell the truth, and steady ourselves to stop the cycle of crazy and lead us all into a better way.\nLisa Whittle is a sought after Bible teacher, and the author of six books, including her latest \"Put Your Warrior Boots On\".

Hollywood and the media will turn you into a hero. But it is a brave thing to stand up to the zeitgeist and culture of fear and bullying the left and media have instilled on the issue of climate change. But President Trump is doing just that. He is defying the left, the media, his children, and many world leaders.\nIn short, he is leading. President Trump is withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord.\nIt is the right decision for a number of reasons.\nFirst, the Paris Accord is being treated by many as a treaty with treaty obligations, but President Obama never submitted it to Congress for passage.\nSecond, though President Trump could have left it in place and done nothing, his successor could have easily revived it if left in place.\nThird, the structure and implementation of the Paris Accord set a terrible precedent. President Obama worked for what amounts to a global agreement with voluntary measures, but those measures would impact the American economy. But, despite that impact, President Obama did not present the Paris Accord to Congress for ratification or debate.\nI do believe the climate is changing. I do believe humans play some role in it. But I also think the certainty with which much of the left clings regarding climate change is more by faith than fact. For years the left has preached climate doom and gloom and they have never been right. They have warned of global cooling and now of global warming.\nTheir only solution in all cases is a command and control economy. Many of them have started profiting from the scare tactics of climate change and others have financial investments that would profit from carbon trading and other schemes. They drive around in SUV\u2019s and fly private planes while telling the rest of us to cut back. For a group of people convinced we\u2019re all going to die, they sure don\u2019t act like they really believe it.\nI simply do not think climate change is an issue worth caring much about and trust that humanity will find ways to adapt to a climate that would change whether or not we were on the planet.\nBut fundamentally, regardless of my views, I think any President of any party trying to bind this nation to a global agreement that will deeply affect our economy must do so only with the consent of the Senate through its constitutional obligation to approve treaties.\nErick Erickson is a Fox News contributor.

I even had a sort of evangelical experience while I was working at a hospital during high school. But by my young adulthood, I was not a model of religious piety. I worked hard, but I did a lot of partying too. I got married at 27 and was divorced by the time I was 32.\nI still have some trouble piecing together how I got so lost in my 20s. But slowly, I returned to the Church.\nAfter an annulment, I remarried, and though my wife didn\u2019t convert to Catholicism until 15 years later, we raised our three children in the Catholic faith.\nMy churchgoing and sacramental life became consistent. I juggled a career and a family, and on Sundays we would go to Mass. Occasionally, I would yearn for greater spiritual engagement, but that feeling would usually disappear amid the busyness of life.\nBut about a dozen years ago, with some significant professional and material success under my belt, I began to feel that something was missing, that maybe these three things in my life \u2013 my family, my faith, and my career \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be separate. And maybe the balance among the three wasn\u2019t quite right.\nSo I started to pray.\nI had this soft inkling, no great thunderbolt, that God wanted me to become more involved in the Church, even to speak or preach there or to be of service in some way. The message seemed to come out of nowhere.\nThe extent of my involvement in church until that time had been to sit in the pews and help with fundraising. But a little voice kept pushing me. So I thought, Okay, I\u2019ll go down this path a little bit.\nI discovered there were plenty of opportunities to become involved in daily parish life, partly because of, no doubt, the decline in vocations.\nMy niche has turned out to be the parish finance committee, but I also serve meals to the homeless who come to our church for help.\nAs part of my due diligence, I went to talk to an old friend of my father\u2019s, theologian Michael Novak. His enthusiasm about the idea of greater lay involvement in the Church led to what, for me, has become a life-changing dialogue.\nWe talked about the future of the Church and all the difficulties it faces in the coming years: the steep decline in the number of clergy and the external pressures from an increasingly secular society are going to make the 21st century a challenging one.\nBut my conversations with Michael made me hopeful about the opportunities for lay people to serve and to deepen their faith, and it became clear that there had been dramatic developments in the wake of Vatican II encouraging lay participation in the Church.\nIndeed, my late father became a Eucharistic minister at age 65. I saw firsthand the great fulfillment it brought him, and I wondered why he didn\u2019t start sooner. I think he would say he wished he had, but that he was too busy with his career and family.\nAnd I wondered if other people might feel the same way or simply do not realize how much they could give and gain by getting more involved in the life of the Church.\nOrdinary Catholics can make extraordinary contributions.

While all congressional leaders want to cut wasteful programs and investigate possible misuse of taxpayer dollars in theory, it is a different matter entirely when the institutions in question are political favorites.\nIn a time where deep cuts are necessary to budgets across the board, Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.) recently sent a letter to Planned Parenthood asking for financial records and documents. The purpose was to learn more about troubling questions facing Planned Parenthood regarding possible misuse of taxpayer dollars and inadequate institutional responses to sexual crimes against young girls and women. Rep. Stearns chairs the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations which is responsible for overseeing federal funds received by the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider.\nUnderstandably, since Planned Parenthood receives more than $363 million in taxpayer funding each year, anxious taxpayers want to know what they are getting for their money.\nNot surprisingly, Planned Parenthood and its lobby \u2013 including Reps. Harry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) \u2013 are up in arms. Reps. Waxman and DeGette asserted in a letter to Rep. Stearns that they are \u201caware of no predicate that would justify\u201d the investigation and asked him to end his inquiry.\nPlanned Parenthood concurred. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards claimed in a recent fundraising appeal that the investigation was \u201cnot about fiscal responsibility.\u201d If the word \u201conly\u201d is added to her assertion, she is correct. The issues involved go beyond merely money.\nAs our organization, Americans United for Life documented in \u201cThe Case for Investigating Planned Parenthood\u201d released in July, substantial evidence exists to counter Planned Parenthood\u2019s assertion that its affiliates have \u201calways complied with all laws and regulations applicable to the receipt and use of federal funds.\u201d Planned Parenthood affiliates in multiple states have been exposed for overbilling government health care and family planning programs.\nFor example, a California audit of Planned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside Counties in 2004 revealed that the one Planned Parenthood affiliate \u2013 in one year alone \u2013 overbilled the Medicaid program by over 5 million dollars.\nAccording to Victor Gonzalez, who was the Vice President of Financial Administration with Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles at the time, the illegal overbilling practice was a state-wide problem at Planned Parenthood. In his whistleblower case, Mr. Gonzalez estimates that over a six-year period beginning in 1999, the overbilling by Planned Parenthood\u2019s California affiliates exceeded $180 million.\nSince 90 percent of that overbilled funding came from federal government, checking further into Planned Parenthood\u2019s finances seems fiscally responsible.\nAudit reports in New Jersey, New York, and Washington likewise have caught Planned Parenthood affiliates taking more from federal government-funded programs than the law allows.\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s transgressions have not been limited to overbilling Medicaid. And much like its overbilling, Planned Parenthood violations of other laws are not isolated or fluke instances.\nPlanned Parenthood affiliates have exhibited a pattern and practice of violating and circumventing parental involvement laws. For example, in 2009, the Alabama Department of Public Health issued a report stating that Planned Parenthood staff at a Birmingham, Alabama abortion clinic \u201cfailed to obtain parental consent for 9 of 9 minor patients in a manner that complies with state legal requirements.\u201d\nLegal action against Planned Parenthood occurred in at least Alabama, Arizona, and Ohio for failure to report the abuse of young girls. Live Action\u2019s undercover investigations indicate that many more Planned Parenthood clinics fail to report instances of suspected sexual abuse, instead advising minors and their abusers on how to circumvent mandatory reporting laws.\nIn addition, video footage recorded by Live Action in three states and the District of Columbia documents an apparent willingness of Planned Parenthood employees to advise and assist an alleged sex-trafficker.\nAbby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood manager confirms that Live Action is not simply \u201clucky\u201d in finding the few cases of Planned Parenthood abuse.\nAsked about the Live Action videos, Ms. Johnson acknowledged, \u201cIt happens all the time, it happened at my clinic\u2026 I let it happen.\u201d\nLive Action\u2019s investigation went viral when footage from the Perth Amboy, N.J. clinic was released earlier this year. In living color, a Planned Parenthood clinic manager gave advice to a self-proclaimed pimp and prostitute on how to skirt the law when bringing in young girls engaged in sex trafficking. After first claiming the video was a hoax, Planned Parenthood eventually fired the employee in question.\nSuch scandals continue to reverberate and have financial implications.\nThe law requires Planned Parenthood employees to properly report suspicions of sexual abuse, sexual trafficking or molestation of underage girls. In fact, the Federal Acquisition Regulation requires every contractor doing business with the federal government to \u201cexercise due diligence to prevent and detect criminal conduct\u201d and to \u201cotherwise promote an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law.\u201d\nNo institution that covers up or turns a blind eye to the crimes of sex offenders, molesters and abuser should expect the taxpayer to write a blank check of support.\nThe time is right for a public accounting of the money already spent and to end the taxpayers\u2019 generous support of the profitable abortion industry.\nRecent polls show that seven in ten Americans do not want their tax dollars subsidizing abortion. Ending funding to Planned Parenthood would therefore be a bipartisan budget cut and long overdue.", "\nOpinion\nOpinion\nTime for Straight Talk On Afghanistan and the War on Terror\nIn deciding to send another 1,400 Marine combat forces to Afghanistan to consolidate gains made during the troop buildup and put extra \u201cpressure\u201d on the insurgents, as Defense Department spokesman Col. Dave Lapan put it Thursday, President Obama is doubling down on his \u201csurge\u201d strategy. He is betting that more American fighters will inflict sufficient pain on the Taliban to prompt them to come to the negotiating table to make a deal, since clearly, America and its allies can\u2019t kill or quell them all before Obama starts withdrawing his surge forces from the country.\nBut this is a risky bet which a growing number of even hawkish critics say is unlikely to work. The most recent among is Robert Blackwill, a tough-minded national security veteran of several Republican administrations. He warns in the new issue of Foreign Affairs that the United States and its allies are \u201cnot on course to defeating the Taliban militarily\u201d and urges instead not more troops but what he calls \u201ca shift to Plan B.\u201d\nThe United States, he points out, now has 150,000 American-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) troops in Afghanistan. This, he notes, \u201cis 30,000 more troops than the Soviet Union deployed in the 1980s, but less than half the number required to have some chance of pacifying the country, according to standard counterinsurgency doctrine.\u201d\nAdding 1,400 more Marines is not likely to change the calculus. Nor will \u201can occupying army largely ignorant of local history, tribal structures, languages, customs, politics, and values\u201d be able to \u201cwin over large numbers of the Afghan Pashtuns, as counterinsurgency doctrine demands.\u201d And it won\u2019t make the Kabul government of Hamid Karzai less corrupt, more effective, or more credible, another indispensable ingredient of a successful counterinsurgency. \"You are only as good as the government you are supporting,\" as David Kilcullen has observed.\nWhat is Blackwill\u201ds Plan B? Essentially, it\u2019s a de facto partition of Afghanistan in which the United States would \u201cstop talking about exit strategies and instead commit the United States to a long-term combat role in Afghanistan of 35,000-50,000 troops\u201d to protect the non-Pashtun parts of the country. It acknowledges that the Taliban will \u201cinevitably control most of the Pashtun south and east\u201d and that \u201cthe price of forestalling that outcome is far too high for the United States to continue paying.\u201d\nIn short, he argues President Obama should announce that the \u201cUnited States and its Afghan and foreign partners will pursue a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy in Pashtun Afghanistan and a nation-building strategy in the rest of the country, committing to both policies for at least the next seven to ten years.\u201d That is not likely to please foreign policy analysts who want the U.S. to withdraw from Afghanistan now. But such a de facto partition, he says, is the best we can hope for.\nI haven\u2019t visited Afghanistan for many years. I\u2019m not sure whether analysts like Blackwill or Max Boot, who says the surge is working and urges us to stay the course, are right.\nBut I do have a sense that Americans are not being told what we need to know about this engagement and its underlying assumptions, length, and real goals. And speaking of counter-terrorism strategies, isn\u2019t it time that the Obama administration acknowledge that we are engaged in a \u201cwar\u201d on Islamic militants if not on their favorite tactic, terrorism, and put a price tag on that war so that Americans understand what we are being asked to pay for it?\nThe time for straight talk and more straightforward financial accountability about the cost of keeping Americans safe from another catastrophic terrorist attack is long overdue.", "\nFILE - In this Jan. 21, 2013 photo, Emma Clyman, 5, of Manhattan, holds a sign that reads \"No More Newtowns\" outside city hall park during the One Million Moms for Gun Control Rally in New York. Despite a proposal backed by over 8 in 10 people in polls, gun control supporters are struggling to win over moderate Democrats in their drive to push expanded background checks of firearms purchasers through the Senate next month. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\nThe U.N.'s Arms Trade Treaty, which seemed dead last July, is beginning to wrap up negotiations. The Obama administration is committed to getting it passed. Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed: \u201cThe United States is steadfast in its commitment to achieve a strong and effective Arms Trade Treaty.\"\nThe treaty was resurrected on Nov. 8 \u2013 the very day after President Obama\u2019s re-election. Very conveniently, that the Obama administration delayed the U.N. vote in favor of renewing negotiations delayed until the president was no longer constrained by public opinion.\nThe Arms Trade Treaty will regulate individual gun ownership all across the world. Each country will be obligated to \u201cmaintain a national control list that shall include [rifles and handguns]\u201d and \"to regulate brokering taking place under its jurisdiction for conventional arms.\u201d In fact, the new background check rules approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee include just those rules -- a registration system and a record of all transfers of guns.\nThe treaty pretends that individual weapons smugglers are the main problem.\nBut nations themselves will be responsible for enforcing the rules. That means Iran, China, Russia \u2013 the leading countries for the truly troubling parts of the international arms trade \u2013 are supposed to curb it. Does anyone actually believe these nations will actually enforce these regulations against themselves?\nDemocracies are a different story. Many of their civilians have freedoms to lose. And they are much more transparent on whether they are actually honoring the rules that apply to their governments.\nJust like with gun control, in general, it is only the \u201cgood guys\u201d who will obey the new rules. The U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, if passed, would only be effective against those countries that choose to obey them.\nThe treaty pretends that individual weapons smugglers are the main problem. But governments, not private individuals, are the primary source of weapons. For example, the FARC guerrillas fighting in Colombia get their guns from the Venezuelan government.\nUnsurprisingly, the U.N. treaty provisions are the long-time favorites of American gun control advocates: registration and licensing of guns and ammunition, along with restrictions on the private gun transfers. Unfortunately, these expensive measures have a long history of failing to curb crime wherever they have been tried and primarily end up disarming law-abiding gun owners.\nThe treaty pushes gun registration and licensing as a way to trace those who supply these illicit weapons. Yet, to see the problem with these regulations, one only needs to look at how ineffective they have been in solving crime. Canada just ended its long gun registry last year, as it was a colossal waste of money.\nIndeed, it is a costly scheme. Beginning in 1998, Canadians spent a whopping $2.7 billion on creating and running a registry just for long guns. With more people and more guns in the United States, the estimated costs for a similar registration scheme for 13 years would be about $67 billion.\nGun control advocates have long claimed registration is a safety issue. Their reasoning is straightforward: If a gun is left at a crime scene, and it was registered to the person who committed the crime, the registry will link it back to the criminal.\nUnfortunately, it rarely works out this way. Criminals are seldom stupid enough to leave behind crime guns that are registered to themselves.\nAs to restrictions on the private transfers of guns, the most common type of regulation discussed in the U.S. today involves background checks. Yet, whether one is talking about the Brady Act or the so-called gun show loophole, economists and criminologists who have looked at this simply don\u2019t find evidence those regulations reduce crime. It may even increase crime, as fewer would-be victims acquire guns. Unfortunately, just like criminal gangs in the U.S. obtaining guns, it is simply wishful thinking that a United Nations treaty \u2013 no matter how well intended \u2013 can do much to stop rebel groups from getting weapons.\nObama likes to believe that his re-election gives him a mandate for sweeping changes. Well, he certainly lacks a mandate for these new gun restrictions, as he tried so hard to avoid the U.N. treaty until after the election.\nThe good news is that even if President Obama signs the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, it is unlikely to be ratified by the US Senate. Nonetheless, by promoting gun control elsewhere in the world, it might eventually lead to more pressure for gun control here at home.", "\nMaybe Majority Leader Harry Reid didn't want a lot of attention as the United States Senate voted on a budget resolution for the first time in four years.

Both houses of Congress have now passed resolutions setting the overall level of outlays for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, as well as subtotals for the budget's major areas.\nAs Reid feared, bringing up a Senate budget resolution put congressional Democrats on record as favoring new taxes and continued deficits.", "\nObamaCare forces a good doctor to quit\nLast week, politicians who helped craft the Affordable Care Act (ACA) celebrated in self-congratulatory style the third anniversary of that monstrosity which will soon extinguish health care as we've known it.\nThe president's promises about the ACA saving money and allowing you to keep your existing health plan are proving false, as many predicted.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services maintains the law will make health care more affordable and accessible. The Wall Street Journal, reminding readers of that claim, reported last week that health insurers are privately warning brokers: \"premiums for many individuals and small businesses could increase sharply next year.\"\nThe 2013 Deloitte Survey of U.S. Physicians, a survey of more than 600 physicians from the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, found that \"Six in 10 physicians (62 percent) said it is likely many of their colleagues will retire earlier than planned in the next one to three years.\"\nBased on the survey results, Deloitte found that most U.S. physicians believe that, among other worries, under Obamacare, \"The future of the medical profession may be in jeopardy as it loses clinical autonomy and compensation\" and \"Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements may be problematic, prompting many physicians to limit or close their practices to these enrollees.\" Instead of the established doctor-patient relationship of old, \"eight in 10 physicians agree \"that the wave of the future in medicine ... involves interdisciplinary teams and care coordinators.\"\nOne who thinks he's seen the future and doesn't like it, is my physician, Dr. John Curry of Fairfax, Va. At my request, he sent me the following e-mail:\n\"Forty years ago, when I began practicing primary care medicine, medical decision-making and its funding were in the hands of patients and their physicians. The only protection patients had lay in the professional ethics of their doctors. In modern terms that sounds pretty skimpy, but think about it for a minute. The first precept was 'Do no harm'. Ask yourself: can you hold your government to that standard?\n\"The underlying principle was that the physician had to put his patients' interests ahead of his own. This was, of course, the Golden Rule, formalized into standards for professional care. It was also the reason I, and many in my class, applied to medical school. It was the reason my wife's older brother, who practiced medicine in a small town in West Texas, prided himself on the fact that much of the time he 'was paid in peas and pies'. Again, ask yourself, is there any health insurance company or government agency that you can count upon to put your health above their interests?\n\"The decades have rolled by, and the sea-changes have come. Costs have risen, and personalized care has faded. The monstrosity has been birthed, and soon you will look in vain if you are seeking a personal physician who knows you, cares about you, and to whom you have ready access. You will find only systems, ready to suck you up, give you a number, and provide you with federally approved accountable care in a sterile environment populated by highly regulated strangers. And it will cost you a lot! (Whatever anyone says, prepare for a future where your health costs will be higher and your choices fewer!)\n\"I am in my mid-70s and have both the capacity and willingness to care for patients for another decade. But I am retiring. I cannot stand it anymore. More than half of my time in the office is spent filling out forms, writing letters, responding to inquiries, and attending to 'urgent' matters that did not exist 10 years ago. And every year my income is less. At this point I would rather be paid nothing and have the freedom to decide what is right for my patients. ACA is only another straw, but for this tired camel, it will break my back.\"\nNeither I, nor the country, can afford to lose doctors like John Curry, but we are and we will.

Discussing breaking Washington's partisan gridlock, the president told TNR,\"If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News...for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you\u2019ll see more of them doing it.\"\nAlas, the president loves to whine about the media meanies at Fox News. To him, these are not people trying to do their jobs. No, they are out to get him. What other motive could a journalist have in holding a president accountable? Why oh why do Ed Henry and Chris Wallace insist on asking hard questions? Make them stop!\nAlas, the president loves to whine about the media meanies at Fox News. To him, these are not people trying to do their jobs. No, they are out to get him.\nThe president seems more comfortable talking to \"real journalists\" such as Chris Hughes, who asked the question in the TNR interview that elicited Obama's reflexive Fox hatred. Hughes is the new owner of TNR and is a former major Obama campaign donor and organizer who was featured on the cover of Fast Company, with the headline, \"The Kid Who Made Obama President.\" You can't make this stuff up.\nThis latest volley from the president is just one in a long line of comments from his White House as part of their campaign to silence any dissent they detect in the press corps.\nRecently, the White House has kept Fox News off of conference calls dealing with the Benghazi attack, despite Fox News being the only outlet that was regularly reporting on it and despite Fox having top notch foreign policy reporters.\nThey have left Chris Wallace\u2019s \"Fox News Sunday\" out of a round of interviews that included CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS for not being part of a \u201clegitimate\u201d news network. In October 2009, as part of an Obama administration onslaught against Fox News,White House senior adviser David Axelrod said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the Fox News Channel is \"not really a news station\" and that much of the programming is \"not really news.\"\nWhether you are liberal or conservative, libertarian, moderate or politically agnostic, everyone should be concerned when leaders of our government believe they can intentionally try to delegitimize a news organization they don\u2019t like.\nIn fact, if you are a liberal \u2013 as I am \u2013 you should be the most offended, as liberalism is founded on the idea of cherishing dissent and an inviolable right to freedom of expression.\nThat more liberals aren't calling out the White House for this outrageous behavior tells you something about the state of liberalism in America today.\nSure, everyone understands how some of Fox's opinion programming would get under President Obama's skin, the same way MSNBC from 4pm until closing time is not the favorite stop for Republicans. But it's not okay -- or presidential -- to continue smearing an entire network of hard working journalists because you are mad at Sean Hannity.\nDuring the initial launch of the war on Fox News in October 2009, then-White House Communications Director Anita Dunn told the New York Times of Fox News, \u201c[W]e don\u2019t need to pretend that this is the way that legitimate news organizations behave.\u201d On CNN, she declared that Fox was a \u201cwing of the Republican Party.\u201d Then: \u201clet's not pretend they're a news network the way CNN is.\"\nGosh, this sounds so familiar. In fact, it\u2019s exactly the line that Media Matters used in a 2010 memo to donors: \u201cFox News is not a news organization. It is the de facto leader of the GOP, and it is long past time that it is treated as such by the media, elected officials and the public.\u201d\nIn fact, this is the signature line of Media Matters in discussing Fox News, which they say they exist to destroy. Their CEO, David Brock told Politico in 2011 that their strategy was a \u201cwar on Fox\u201d that is executed by 90 staff members and a $10 million yearly budget, gratis liberal donors.\nCan someone explain to me how it\u2019s \u201cliberal\u201d to try and shut down a media organization? What the Obama administration is doing, and what liberals are funding at MMFA is beyond chilling \u2013 it\u2019s a deep freeze.\nOn the heels of Dunn\u2019s attack on Fox, Brock wrote a letter to progressive organizations bragging about the U.S. government trashing a news organization: \u201cIn recent days, a new level of scrutiny has been directed toward Fox News, in no small part due to statements from the White House, and from Media Matters, challenging its standing as a news organization.\u201d Point of order: who put Media Matters in charge of determining what is and isn't a news operation?\nA Media Matters memo found its way into the public domain and if you care at all about decency and freedom of the press, it will make you throw up. If you like McCarthyism, it\u2019s right up your alley. It details to liberal donors how they have plans to assemble opposition research on Fox News employees.\nIt complains of the \u201cpervasive unwillingness among members of the media to officially kick Fox News to the curb of the press club\u201d and outlines how they are going to change that through targeting elite media figures and turning them against Fox. They say they want to set up a legal fund to sue (harass) conservatives for any \u201cslanderous\u201d comments they make about progressives on air. They actually cite one of the best journalists around, Jake Tapper, as a problem because he questioned the White House about calling a news outlet \u201cillegitimate.\u201d Tapper can see the obvious: if the White House can call one news outlet illegitimate for asking tough questions, then guess who is next? Anyone.\nWe defend freedom of the press because of the principle, not because we like everything the press does. For example, I defend MSNBC\u2019s right to run liberal programming to their hearts content.\nMonitoring the media is actually a good thing; the media should be held accountable, including Fox News. When MMFA began I was supportive of their endeavor and even used some of their research. They seemed a counterbalance to conservative media monitoring organizations.\nBut now the mask is off. They make no bones about their intentions, and it's not a fair media. It is clear now that the idea of freedom of the press actually offends Media Matters. In their memo, they complain about \u201can expansive view of legal precedent protecting the freedom of the press, and the progressive movement's own commitment to the First Amendment\u201d as an impediment to be overcome or changed. They say they are \u201cconsider[ing] pushing prominent progressives to stop appearing on Fox News.\u201d For those who defy the order, they threaten to start daily publishing the names of Democrats who appear in order to shame them. If that doesn\u2019t work, presumably they will just shave our heads and march us down Constitution Avenue.\nWhen Anita Dunn was informing America \u2013 as a senior government official \u2013 which news organizations were \u201clegitimate,\u201d she conveniently deemed CNN, which rarely challenges the White House, as a \u201creal\u201d network. Presumably she believes MSNBC is \u201clegitimate\u201d also, despite their undisguised disgust of the GOP and hagiography of the president, not to mention more opinion programming than any cable outlet.\nI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and assume she thinks CBS is \u201clegitimate\u201d after they just ran what amounted to a 2016 ad for Hillary Clinton on \"60 Minutes.\" CBS is the same place that has a political director who also writes for one of the most liberal outlets in the country, Slate. Who also just wrote in that publication that the president should \u201cpulverize\u201d the GOP. Imagine a political director at CBS hired away from the Weekly Standard who then wrote an article about \"pulverizing\" Democrats. I know, I lost you at the part where CBS hired a political director from a conservative outlet.\nLast week Rolling Stone editor Michael Hastings \u2013 who is a liberal and said recently that \u201cmost journalists I know are liberal\u201d \u2013 discussed his time covering Obama on the campaign trail. Among the things he witnessed was a reporter trying to interview Obama using a sock puppet.\nHe told MSNBCs Martin Bashir, \u201cThat\u2019s the presence of Obama, even on the press corps, even on the people who follow him every day. When they are near him, they lose their mind sometimes. They start behaving in ways, you know, that are juvenile and amateurish and they swoon.\u201d\nHastings admitted that the presence of Obama made him go gooey too. \"Did I ask about drones, did I ask about civil liberties? No, I did not.\u201d\nI guess this is what the White House and their friends at Media Matters call the \u201clegitimate\u201d media.", "\nThen Tina Turner went public. She is renouncing her U.S. citizenship to become a Swiss citizen- which just happens to have lower taxes than Obama\u2019s America.\nBut these are just the rich celebrities courageous enough to go public. This is merely the tip of the iceberg. The rich are fleeing in droves. The Obama tax and spend Ponzi scheme is imploding.\nWhat changed?\nThe technology revolution has made it possible to do business from places where the taxes are lower (or non existent) and where the government treats us better. Obama had better learn this lesson fast, because this tax rebellion is spreading to millions of Americans with far smaller incomes or assets than Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, or Manny Pacquaio.\nThe signs are everywhere that a tax rebellion has begun.\nThe latest U.S. Census showed us that the states with low taxes enjoyed the fastest population growth- states like Nevada, Texas, Florida, and Arizona.\nNot surprisingly, the states losing the most population are all high tax states like California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, and of course Obama\u2019s Illinois.\nThese states that Americans are running from are all governed just like Obama wants to govern the entire country. Soon these same Americans running away from California, New York and Illinois will instead be running away from America.\nAsk the co-founder of Facebook, who recently renounced his citizenship and left for Singapore (where the capital gains taxes are zero).\nHigh taxes have worked well in England\u2026they are about to endure an unheard of in history triple dip recession\u2026the third recession in 5 years.

I woke up every morning to walk on the beach, and to watch dolphins swim from my deck. I married a former Miss Oklahoma. I was in heaven.\nUnfortunately, during the next decade California grew more and more desperate. Taxes were raised again and again. There were so many rules, regulations, and lawsuits, it became impossible to run a business in California. So I escaped to Las Vegas, Nevada.\nLas Vegas is \u201cAmerica\u2019s Monte Carlo.\u201d It\u2019s a place with no state income tax, business income tax, capital gains tax, or inheritance tax\u2026and the 16th lowest property taxes in America. A place where the state constitution bans income taxes, limits the time politicians can meet, and welcomes guns in the hands of law abiding citizens. I call it heaven. As long as the taxes stay at zero, I\u2019ll never leave.\nBut I'm not alone. During the past decade over 1.3 million residents escaped California. When I add up the income taxes, property taxes, business taxes, and the payroll and income taxes for the 100 employees I took with me\u2026chasing me away probably cost California about $2,000,000 in lost revenues. Multiply that times thousands of other high income, high net worth, business owners among the 1.3 million who have escaped...and that accounts for why California is always broke, insolvent, and desperate.\nYou know what they say about pigs- they get slaughtered. California is certainly a pig. Just like the \"PIIGS\" in Europe- Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain all chased away their richest citizens and business owners. Now they have nothing left. Their tax base is destroyed. Add France and the UK to the list. There all going down.\nIf we let big government progressives have their way, California\u2019s sad story and Europe\u2019s tragic story will also be America\u2019s sad story. Obama is killing the American Dream. Phil Mickelson was only vocalizing what millions of business owners in America are thinking right now.\nGovernments lie when they say taxes are good, or \u201cfair\u201d or the price you must pay for a \u201ccivilized society.\u201d Big government doesn\u2019t lead to a better life. Big government leads to a miserable life. I\u2019m enjoying a much better quality of life in Nevada with lower taxes- it isn\u2019t even close.\nHere\u2019s the reality -- the high tech revolution has killed the progressive and socialist dream. We aren\u2019t trapped anymore. You can\u2019t tax us to death, simply because you don\u2019t own us. We have I-Phones, I-Pads, I-Pods, text, laptops, and Satellite TV. We can do business from anywhere in the world- from a beach in Sydney, to a mountaintop in Nepal, to a forest in New Zealand, to a luxury high rise in Hong Kong. It\u2019s called freedom.\nSorry, President Obama your dream is about to collapse. Ask Phil Mickelson, or the President of France, or all those millionaires missing in England, or soon half the business owners in America.", "\nImmigration and freedom\nJan. 29, 2013: Members of the DREAM Team LA, a Los Angeles immigrants rights group, watch a live C-Span video stream of President Barack Obama at Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles.Damian Dovarganes/AP\nAs President Obama and Congress grapple for prominence in the debate over immigration, both have lost sight of the true nature of the issue at hand.\nThe issue the politicians and bureaucrats would rather avoid is the natural law. The natural law is a term used to refer to human rights that all persons possess by virtue of our humanity. These rights encompass areas of human behavior where individuals are sovereign and thus need no permission from the government before making choices in those areas. Truly, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, only God is sovereign -- meaning He is the source of His own power.\nHaving received freedom from our Creator and, in America, thanks to the values embraced by most of the Founding Fathers, individuals are sovereign with respect to our natural rights. St. Thomas Aquinas taught that our sovereignty is a part of our human nature, and our humanity is a gift from God. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson himself recognized personal sovereignty in the Declaration of Independence when he wrote about Nature\u2019s God as the Creator and thus the originator of our inalienable human rights.\nIf the government can restrain the freedom to travel on the basis of an immutable characteristic of birth, there is no limit to the restraints it can impose.\nThe rights that Jefferson identified consist of the well-known litany of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. By the time his ideological soul mate James Madison was serving as the scrivener at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the list of natural rights had been expanded to include those now encompassed by the Bill of Rights. Yet again, the authors of the Constitution and its first 10 amendments recognized that the rights being insulated from government interference had their origin in a source other than the government.\nThis view of the natural law is sweet to the heart and pleasing to the ear when politicians praise it at patriotic events, but it is also a bane to them when it restrains their exercise of the coercive powers of the government. Thus, since the freedom of speech, the development of personality, the right to worship or not to worship, the right to use technologically contemporary means for self-defense, the right to be left alone, and the right to own and use property all stem from our humanity, the government simply is without authority to regulate human behavior in these areas, no matter what powers it purports to give to itself and no matter what crises may occur. Among the rights in this category is the freedom of movement, which today is called the right to travel.\nThe right to travel is an individual personal human right, long recognized under the natural law as immune from governmental interference. Of course, governments have been interfering with this right for millennia. The Romans restricted the travel of Jews; Parliament restricted the travel of serfs; Congress restricted the travel of slaves; and starting in the late 19th century, the federal government has restricted the travel of non-Americans who want to come here and even the travel of those already here. All of these abominable restrictions of the right to travel are based not on any culpability of individuals, but rather on membership in the groups to which persons have belonged from birth.\nThe initial reasons for these immigration restrictions involved the different appearance and culture of those seeking to come here and the nativism of those running the government here. Somehow, the people who ran the government believed that they who were born here were superior persons and more worthy of American-style freedoms than those who sought to come here. This extols nativism.\nNativism is the arch-enemy of the freedom to travel, as its adherents believe they can use the coercive power of the government to impair the freedom of travel of persons who are unwanted not because of personal behavior, but solely on the basis of where they were born. Nativism teaches that we lack natural rights and enjoy only those rights the government permits us to exercise.\nYet, the freedom to travel is a fundamental natural right. This is not a novel view. In addition to Aquinas and Jefferson, it has been embraced by St. Augustine, John Locke, Thomas Paine, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Pope John Paul II and Justice Clarence Thomas. Our fundamental human rights are not conditioned or even conditionable on the laws or traditions of the place where our mothers were physically located when we were born. They are not attenuated because our mothers were not in the United States at the moment of our births. Stated differently, we all possess natural rights, no more and no less than any others. All humans have the full panoply of freedom of choice in areas of personal behavior protected from governmental interference by the natural law, no matter where they were born.\nAmericans are not possessed of more natural rights than non-Americans; rather, we enjoy more opportunities to exercise those rights because the government is theoretically restrained by the Constitution, which explicitly recognizes the natural law. That recognition is articulated in the Ninth Amendment, which declares that the enumeration of certain rights in the Constitution shall not be used by the government as an excuse to deny or disparage other unnamed and unnamable rights retained by the people.\nSo, if I want to invite my cousins from Florence, Italy, to come here and live in my house and work on my farm in New Jersey, or if a multinational corporation wants the best engineers from India to work in its labs in Texas, or if my neighbor wants a friend of a friend from Mexico City to come here to work in his shop, we have the natural right to ask, they have the natural right to come here, and the government has no moral right to interfere with any of these freely made decisions.\nIf the government can restrain the freedom to travel on the basis of an immutable characteristic of birth, there is no limit to the restraints it can impose.", "\nObamaCare relaunch \u2013 still playing God with the free market and your health\nD-day arrived for ObamaCare Saturday, and began with an 11 hour shutdown of HealthCare.gov\u2014the problem plagued website intended to provide easy access to affordable insurance for millions of Americans.\nThe contraption is functioning better but is still terribly inadequate. It can only handle 50,000 users at a time, well short of the volume needed to assist the millions of Americans who must purchase health insurance by year end or face fines.\nThose eligible for subsidies must use the system, but often the system can\u2019t verify eligibility for aid. Many are in limbo -- applications already initiated are stalled, lost or otherwise can\u2019t be completed. Healthcare.gov software to get insurance companies paid subsidies is not functioning effectively, and the small business site that was to offer group coverage has been postponed one year.\nOnly God can make a tree, and in his creation, only the invisible hand can make a market.\nEventually Jeffrey Zients, the White House\u2019s website repair czar, will have this monster fulfilling all its functions, but likely it will be a balky, frustrating website, much like other federal websites or those run by private firms enjoying monopoly power.\nHealth insurance will be right up there with dealing with tax filing.\nBureaucrats will have easy access to sensitive personal data, which Obama administration political moles can use to target, harass and sometimes destroy critics, and simply occupy millions of hours of citizens\u2019 time that could be used more productively.\nWelcome to statism -- the ants of capitalism herded into a bureaucratic hell to serve the masters of a grander design.\nAll this aside, let\u2019s look at the list of promises that will remain unkept when the website is fully repaired, no matter how well it may run:\n1. If you like your insurance, you can keep it.\n2. If you like your doctor, you can keep him.\n3. If you need help finding the coverage you need, we will make it easy.\n4. And, by organizing the health care market under the guiding hand of the omnipotent state, we will make insurance cheaper.\nThe first two promises are forever broken. Insurance companies can\u2019t bring back most policies the Affordable Health Care Act declared illegal, a presidential edict notwithstanding.\nAnd insurance companies are slashing doctors and hospitals from their networks to meet arbitrary ObamaCare mandates.\nFolks who had perfectly adequate policies, which were delivering hundreds of thousands of dollars in life saving benefits from specialized physicians for cancer treatment and other complex illnesses, have lost those benefits and been offered replacement policies cluttered with unneeded services. For example, pediatric vision care for childless couples in their 50s and birth control benefits for nuns.\nMany Americans will literally face death when old policies lapse and can no longer pay for the care they need. But as a Washington lawyer and ardent support of the president insisted, some sacrifice is needed by a few for the progress of the many.\nTo me, this stunning assurance had echoes of Joseph Stalin, who killed thousands building the Moscow subway! -- Some must simply be lost in the name of progress and serving the state.\nOverall, premium costs are skyrocketing for many Americans, not because their old coverage was inadequate or because new coverage is better, but because they are in markets now served by fewer providers and less competition than before.\nBusinesses are forced to jettison full time positions in favor or part-time workers to avoid paying health benefits they can no longer afford and avoid penalties that will be imposed beginning in 2015.\nAmericans are burdened with about 20 new taxes and fees and higher premiums and co-pays for insurance policies that work about the same or worse for most middle-class families -- the folks the president and his fellow Democrats say they want to help.\nIt took a triumph of hubris for the president to believe he could sign a single law that would replace markets in a U.S. health care sector as large as the economy of France.\nOnly God can make a tree, and in his creation, only the invisible hand can make a market.\nWhen the government tries to replace free markets, it plays God ... and does so very badly.\nPeter Morici is an economist and professor at the Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, and widely published columnist.

Though aligned with most Americans in opposition to ObamaCare, Republicans are sinking deeper and deeper into a hole of their own digging.\nNo matter how hard they try to align themselves with a majority of Americans, Republicans simply aren\u2019t connecting with the middle class, who view them as a party of \u201cold, rich, white men,\u201d or \u201cthe party of \u2018no.\u2019\u201d These perceptions are reflected in recent poll numbers, which show GOP approval ratings hovering below 30%.\nAs someone who manages brands for a living, I can assert with confidence that all successful brands stand for something. It is not enough to merely be against something, no matter how unpopular that \u201csomething\u201d is. All durable brands are associated with at least one positive attribute in the minds of consumers - or in this case, voters.\nThat is certainly not the case for the GOP right now.\nAmericans want leadership on the issue of health care, and they will reject politicians who delay the hard work of problem-solving.\nAs such, the GOP\u2019s anti-ObamaCare rhetoric has gone stale. Republicans must abandon their \u201cparty of \u2018no\u2019\u201d moniker, by sharing their vision of what \u201cno\u201d should be replaced with. In other words, Republicans must explain to voters what they stand for, as well as what they\u2019re against.\nA party that controls only one chamber of the legislative branch cannot make public policy. But the House GOP can facilitate the collapse of ObamaCare by aligning Republicans with the interests of hardworking Americans, and forcing Democrats to side with the special interest groups that are poised to profit from them.\nIn order for this to work, actions taken by the House GOP should be accompanied by simple, straightforward messaging, so that voters can connect with the Republican narrative on a visceral level.\nVisceral connections require visceral emotions -- and only two things stoke the ire of Americans as deeply as Congress: trial lawyers and insurance companies. If Republicans leverage this antipathy to their advantage, Democrats will find themselves in the unenviable position of being defenders of both.\nThe House should pass two bills, recognizing that Frosty the Snowman has better prospects on a Hawaiian vacation than these bills do of ever becoming law. Nonetheless, they will set the stage for Republicans to become day-saving heroes for most voters on the issue of health care.\nFirst, the House should pass a tort reform bill aimed at reducing medical malpractice premiums, for the sole purpose of reducing health care costs. GOP messaging points should target trial lawyers, framing them as special interest groups, explaining how they\u2019ve influenced the architects of ObamaCare and how they plan to profit from it.\nConcurrently, Republicans should explain how tort reform would decrease doctors\u2019 costs of doing business, and how those savings would be passed on to hardworking Americans.\nA few weeks later, the House should pass another bill permitting interstate competition for health insurance companies.\nDoing so would force Democrats to defend ObamaCare\u2019s protection of these quasi monopolies.\nGOP messaging should highlight Democrats\u2019 crony capitalism at the expense of free-market competition and individual choice.\nObamaCare is a \u201cteachable moment\u201d in this regard. Americans will always choose freedom and choice over being told what to do, so long as Republicans connect the dots for them.\nWill these two bills and messaging points represent all that is needed to repair the GOP\u2019s brand? Absolutely not. There is far more work to be done on that front.\nBut these initial efforts represent a meaningful first step in the right direction: one that recasts Republicans as defenders of the middle class, rather than merely an unpalatable alternative to the left.\nJohn Jordan is CEO of Jordan Winery, co-founder of Labrador OmniMedia (creator of Tastevin, a tablet-based restaurant beverage list software), and is a member of the Hoover Institution\u2019s Board of Overseers at Stanford University.", "\nObamaCare's arrogance, corruption and abuse is just beginning\nIt took paramount arrogance for President Obama and congressional Democrats to believe they could write an Affordable Care Act that would replace free markets across a health care sector as large as the economy of France.\nAmong the results include five million Americans with private insurance who are getting cancellation letters for policies the president promised they could keep. As Obama claims, some had \"substandard\" coverage, but many had perfectly good policies.\nStories are surfacing of cancer patients -- now facing the loss of insurance policies that paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in life-saving treatments -- who cannot access the government run exchange.

They will face lower incomes and reduced professional satisfaction which will be reflected in the care they provide.\nAnd... voila! There you have it: ObamaCare raises costs, lowers quality and slashes the incomes of many health care providers.\nSo, where are all those rising health insurance premiums going?\nSimultaneously, the ACA made illegal many perfectly adequate private and employer-based policies, and required insurance companies to offer one-size-fits-all alternatives in each county across the country.\nCautious about the claims liabilities created by the uncertain risk characteristics of new pools of policyholders, insurance companies withdrew from many markets. Those that remain face much less competition and they can jack up rates, and slash doctors\u2019 fees.\nThat is a classic prescription for monopoly profits at health insurance companies and outlandish executive bonuses.\nThe Justice Department has indicated little inclination to investigate these abuses under antitrust laws. It\u2019s too busy seeking criminal indictments on Wall Street for sins committed during the financial crisis -- five years later and only after many bank executives declined to support Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection bid.\nIt\u2019s hardly an accident that health companies have become cozy with the administration and congressional Democrats.

But the administration\u2019s ill-advised defense cuts promise to have a far-reaching and profound impact, putting additional burdens on members of the National Guard and hurting military communities across the country.\nThe budget recommends another Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC), despite the lack of tangible, long-term savings from the BRAC round in 2005.\nThe best interests of our service members must prevail, just as they did in the aftermath of the military pension cuts included in the bipartisan budget agreement last year.\nAs an early opponent of these cuts, I was pleased when the onerous provision was repealed with overwhelming support by both political parties.\nI am troubled, however, that adjustments to military compensation were not merely an oversight in the search for savings. As the president\u2019s FY2015 budget illustrates, the benefits and pay of our men and women in uniform are still a target for reductions. Meanwhile, urgent and critical reforms to the exponential growth of mandatory, non-defense spending are left undone. In fact, the president\u2019s budget exceeds the spending caps he signed into law just a couple of months ago.\nAt the very least, the administration should wait for the results of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. Congress needs the commission\u2019s guidance to mitigate the negative impact of cuts on service members and their families. It is unreasonable for service members to endure more severe cuts than federal bureaucrats.\nWhen unveiling the Pentagon\u2019s budget, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel implied that the drawdown of forces in Iraq and Afghanistan now merited the adjustment of military compensation and personnel. But it is shortsighted to use these conflicts as rationale for less manpower or lower compensation.\nThe national security challenges faced by today\u2019s service members are just as complicated and perilous as they were immediately after Sept. 11 \u2013 if not more so.\nIn many ways, the administration\u2019s skeleton defense budget echoes the argument that President Obama made during the 2012 campaign debate with presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The president quipped that \u201cwe also have fewer horses and bayonets\u201d when questioned about the dwindling size of the Navy and its implications on national security.\nThe president is mistaken to suggest that modernizing America\u2019s defense capabilities is an excuse to gut them. For all the technological advancements at our disposal, we still rely on soldiers to execute our country\u2019s missions at home and abroad.\nMissing from the Obama administration\u2019s defense budget is the confidence that America will have the capacity to lead if a crisis arises. The tyrants of the world are not likely to behave because of the president\u2019s rhetoric alone. The integrity of U.S. strength is an important factor in the decisions of both our allies and our adversaries.\nA better budget would pave the way for the continued strength and preparedness of our all-volunteer military, assuring future recruits that the government will not go back on its promises.\nA better budget would signal to our enemies that the United States remains a formidable power committed to protecting democracy and freedom around the world.\nNeither aim is impossible, even in difficult financial times.

He ministers to two congregations and works a full-time job at the Indianola Pecan House. The 27-year-old is married and has four children. His oldest is five, the youngest is one. And on Feb. 17th he became a victim of ObamaCare.\nA jarring thought crossed the Baptist preacher\u2019s mind: he no longer had health insurance.\nMatthew Morgan was a creature of habit. Every morning before the sun rose over the Mississippi Delta, he would lace up his running shoes, and pound the pavement with three other runners. Twelve mile runs were the norm but on the 17th \u2013 they decided on a lighter run. The nine-mile run that day would take them deep into the countryside.\nIt was Monday. 5:45 a.m. The runners had just reached the turn-around point. Two were setting the pace. Matthew and another runner trailed behind. He saw a car approaching and Matthew crossed over to the other side. It was a move that would soon have life-altering implications.\n\u201cI remember hearing tires squeal,\u201d he told me. \u201cI turned around and saw very dim headlights. I tried to move out of the way.\u201d\nBut it was too late.\nThe 1999 Dodge Ram slammed into the young preacher. He was thrown onto the hood of the truck.

I had been hit by a truck and needed her to come and get me.\u201d\nThe other runners heard his screams and came to his side.

They would have to reduce the compress fracture on site \u2013 the middle of the road \u2013 without any medication.\n\u201cHe took my foot and put it back on my leg,\u201d he said. \u201cHe put everything back in place and wrapped it up.\u201d\nA bit later, the police and paramedics arrived and rushed the preacher to the nearest hospital \u2013 miles away. He was allowed to come home after a week in the hospital, but he still has to endure eight hours of daily antibiotic treatments. He\u2019s confined to a wheelchair \u2013 and he faces more surgery in the coming days.\nAs if that\u2019s not enough to worry about, Matthew has to figure out how to pay for his medical treatment. Because of the Affordable Care Act, he doesn\u2019t have health insurance \u2013 and he\u2019s now on the hook for more than $100,000 in bills.\nMatthew and his wife used to have insurance through Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Like many Americans, they received a letter in 2013 informing them of a hike in premiums. The couple had been paying $550 per month for their plan and Blue Cross was raising the rate by more than 15 percent. Even though they liked their insurance plan, Matthew said it was no longer in their budget.\n\u201cIt was a significant increase that we could not afford,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to let it go and find something new that would be better for us financially.\u201d\nThe Morgans tried to sign up for ObamaCare on the Healthcare.gov website, but Matthew said that was a fruitless effort.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get on the website,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of our issues as we shopped around. Then, we received the notification from the Internal Revenue Service that we would be penalized if we didn\u2019t have health insurance. We were in the process of trying to get it as soon as possible. The website being down did not help.\u201d\nThe Morgans eventually found an insurance plan. It goes into effect in April \u2013 too late to help with their current predicament.\n\u201cThe only reason our other insurance became expensive is when the Affordable Care Act came into play,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would still have the same health insurance if ObamaCare had not been around.\u201d\nA few weeks ago Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said there are no such things as ObamaCare horror stories.\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of horror stories being told, all of them untrue \u2013 but they\u2019re being told all over America,\u201d Reid said in a speech on the Senate floor. \u201cRepublicans may need tall tales and outright lies to convince people that ObamaCare\u2019s bad for them \u2013 but Democrats \u2013 we don\u2019t have to make things up.\u201d\nSo is Matthew Morgan a liar, Sen. Reid? Are you trying to tell us that this Baptist preacher from Mississippi made up his story? Are you trying to say he doesn\u2019t have an ObamaCare horror story?\nMaybe instead of playing partisan politics, Harry Reid could catch the next flight down to the Mississippi Delta and give this young preacher a helping hand \u2013 maybe mow the grass or buy a bag of groceries.\nMatthew Morgan is a victim of ObamaCare \u2013 one of many. But Democrats would like you to believe that people like Matthew are liars. Those are Harry Reid\u2019s words.\nI\u2019d rather put my trust in a Baptist preacher than a leader of political party that booed God.\nEditor's note: A fund has been set up to help the Morgan family.

Some 220,000 residents of West African countries have visas that permit them to enter the United States.\nThe World Health Organization and West African political leaders have pleaded against a travel ban, saying it will cripple the economies of these stricken countries. But our president also has an obligation to protect us.\nAs the disease increases exponentially, the likelihood also increases that a person carrying Ebola, perhaps unknowingly, travels to the United States before symptom\u2019s appear.\nNortheastern University professor Allesandra Vespignanini and his research team have developed a computerized risk assessment based on travel patterns, and pegs the risk at no more than 15 percent.\nRegardless of the small figure, the frightening truth is that most hospitals in the U.S. are unprepared for a patient unknowingly infected with Ebola.\nHospitals that cannot stop the spread of MRSA, C. diff and VRE won\u2019t be able to contain Ebola.\nSome seventy-five thousand patients die each year in U.S. hospitals from infections spread patient\u2014to-patient, according to the CDC. The same lax hygiene that allows those deaths to occur would allow Ebola to race through hospitals as well.\nOn August 1, the CDC issued guidelines to U.S. hospitals on how to dispose of bodily fluids, soiled bed linens, and other contamination from an Ebola-infected patient. But one misstep could cost health care workers or other patients their lives.\nThe World Health Organization and West African political leaders have pleaded against a travel ban, saying it will cripple the economies of these stricken countries. But our president also has an obligation to protect us.\nHere is where our president\u2019s plan fails most. Less than one month ago, the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security released a shocking report showing that the stockpiles of medications, protective clothing, and other supplies needed to protect Americans in the event of a man-made or naturally caused disease outbreak were expired or near-expired, damaged, missing, or inappropriate.\nWhere\u2019s the attention to protecting Americans? The Inspector General flunked Homeland Security on all measures: planning, storage, and replenishment of the medical supplies that would be needed in a national emergency.\nCongress, by the way, funded that pandemic preparedness program in 2006 for a mere $46 million\u2014a tiny fraction of what Obama is sending to West Africa.\nThen there is the danger of deploying the military to tame a disease outbreak. It\u2019s true that the U. S. military has specially trained personnel to deal with weapons of mass destruction and to work wearing hazmat suits and other protective gear. But are those the only personnel who will be sent to the region? Among the troops\u2019 responsibilities, according to Obama, will be safeguarding healthcare workers.\nHundreds of health care workers already have contracted Ebola, and tragically more will, putting everyone around them at risk. It is reported that the Georgia-based Phoenix air service that evacuated two healthcare workers to Emory University in July would be used to evacuate any American personnel infected. But will they survive?\nToo little is known about how the disease is currently spreading. Scientists are raising questions about whether the burning of Ebola-infected corpses at low temperatures could be allowing the virus to spread in the smoke. Sierra Leone began a three day lockdown on Friday, ordering people off the streets and into their homes in a frantic effort to stamp out the disease.\nInfection isn\u2019t the only risk. Eight members of a team, including healthcare workers, journalists, and government officials, sent to a remote Guinea village to raise Ebola awareness were hacked to death by villagers, who then dumped their bodies into a septic tank.\nThe military is also bearing the brunt of the cost. Most of the money for the president\u2019s Ebola initiave, $500 million, is being shifted from Defense Department contingency operations, an important concern since the Defense Department has 21% fewer funds than before Obama became president and is facing the ISIS terror threat.\nDespite these concerns, members of Congress from both parties are uncritically endorsing the president\u2019s Ebola plan and pledging the additional funding the president has requested. It\u2019s a heartwarming display of compassion and bipartisan cooperation, but it doesn\u2019t address the tough questions about keeping Americans safe.\nThe same members of Congress grilling the military about \"boots on the ground\" in Syria ought to be asking questions about what the military will be expected to do in West Africa.", "\nISIS threat: Americans are passengers on Titanic with Obama at helm\nPresident Obama\u2019s recent speech on how to defeat the terrorist group ISIS \u2014 as America faces the greatest threat in its history \u2014 represented \u201cone small step for man\u201d but no \u201cgiant leap for mankind\u201d in attacking the source of the problem.\nSecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey were on the hot seat defending Obama\u2019s ISIS game plan at a Sept. 16 hearing in the Senate. Their testimony suggested a disconnect between the White House and the Pentagon on the need for ground troops, the former having said no and the latter now saying maybe.\nISIS\u2019 destruction may be Obama\u2019s goal, but he still lacks a strategy. The Senate testimony did nothing to suggest otherwise.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nViolence encountered by the West is but the tip of an Islamic iceberg. By failing to attack it, we become passengers onboard an ill-fated Titanic.\nImagine if BP had focused only on the cleanup and not on the source of the leak after the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf. BP would still be cleaning up the environmental mess today.\nSimilarly, as ISIS takes a human toll in the Middle East, its destruction fails to focus on the source.\nListing ISIS\u2019 barbaric acts \u2014 torture, rape, beheadings, etc. \u2014 Obama said the terrorist group is misguided and does not represent Islam.\nBut by seeking to detach ISIS from Islam, it is Obama who is misguided. Every barbaric act he mentioned is sanctioned by Islam and, in fact, has been committed by Muslims during their 1400-year history.\nIronically, while Muhammad\u2019s violence targets Jews, Christians and other non-Muslims, Muslims have claimed most of their victims through \u201ccannibalization.\u201d They\u2019ve been \u201ceating their own,\u201d with Muslim sects relegating other Muslim sects to non-Muslim status.\nObama fails to understand that a Muslim world united under a single global caliphate, whether it be ISIS, Al Qaeda, Iran, etc., will fully project its violence against the Koran\u2019s intended targets \u2014 non-Muslims \u2014 doing so not as a detached religion, but as Islam itself dictates.\nThe violence encountered by the West so far is but the tip of an Islamic iceberg. By failing to recognize this, we become passengers on an ill-fated Titanic, with Obama at the helm, refusing to warn us. Politically correct, as always, he misrepresents Islam and leaves us apathetic and in the dark, blind to Muslims\u2019 plan to destroy Western democracies.\nViolence against non-Muslims, mandated by the Koran, is perpetual \u2014 or until the caliphate\u2019s establishment. A newly independent America quickly discovered this when it fought an unprovoked war with Islam\u2019s Barbary pirates, who justified their violence under the Koran.\nIn modern times, we open our doors to Islam, failing to understand that it is an ideology still dedicated to America\u2019s destruction. We naively do so because Muslims, as well as Obama, claim Islam is a religion of peace.\nIf we open our doors to Islam and allow its influence to grow, its dark side will be revealed; but, meanwhile, those trying to sound the ship\u2019s alarm are labeled as Islamophobes.\nWe have ignored many warning signs of Islam\u2019s evil intent to destroy the West \u201cfrom within,\u201d which was the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s strategy over two decades ago:\n\u2022 In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders repeatedly tries to educate us about Islam\u2019s dark side \u2014 and his government calls him Islamophobic.\n\u2022 In England, Brits watch Shariah evolve in parallel with their own legal system. They are only now awakening to the danger, and it may be too late to reverse it.\n\u2022 In France, Muslims, using an undercurrent of anti-Semitism, encourage others to join them, successfully driving out Jews. Soon the Muslim focus will turn to the others, as well.\n\u2022 In Germany, concerns arise about Shariah law encroachment, triggering a major confrontation yet to play out.\nIn a television interview last month, Anjem Choudary, a British-born convert to Islam who became an imam, gloated over the inroads Islam has made in England \u2014 and even supported ISIS\u2019 brutality. Ironically, he spreads hate in Britain while he collects $43,000 in welfare \u2014 brazenly accepting it as England\u2019s recognition of Islam\u2019s superiority.\nChoudary warns that Shariah is coming to America \u2014 a door now ajar.\nWithin Western democracies today, it is not ISIS that is the immediate threat. It is Islam\u2019s dark side.\nWhile naivet\u00e9 opened doors for Islam\u2019s Dr. Jekyll, the West now suffers the homicidal mania of Islam\u2019s Mr. Hyde. Obama\u2019s speech offers nothing to stop him.", "\nBrendan Tevlin shooting: Where's the outrage over a killing by a self-professed jihadist?\nThat\u2019s what President Obama said about Trayvon Martin in 2012. And it was true. He could\u2019ve passed for the president\u2019s son. No doubt Trayvon\u2019s parents miss him every day.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe president also expressed outrage about the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri this summer.\nAnd rightly so, no parents should have to bury their sons. It is tragic.\nWhen I look at this picture of Brendan Tevlin, I think, he could have been my son. A 19-year-old, suburban boy. Strawberry blond, athletic, bright and smiley.\nBrendan could be my son, or yours. His only crime? Being in the wrong place at the wrong time, targeted by a person terrorizing a community and exacting revenge.\nOn June 25, he texted his Mom, Allison, that he was on his way home from a friend\u2019s house. But he never made it there.\nMinutes later, Ali Muhammad Brown walked up to Brendan\u2019s family car, which was stopped at a red light, fired ten rounds into the car and killed him.\nBrown then allegedly drove the car, with Brendan still in it, to a parking lot and left him there.\nWe live not far from the Tevlins in New Jersey, and word of the tragedy spread quickly. Carjacking? Robbery? What could have happened?\nThen at a press conference, the police said the killing was \u201ctargeted.\u201d That was a loaded word.\nEveryone, including me, thought this: Oh, I see. Brendan was the one picked that night to go buy the pot from some guy in a parking lot and something went very wrong.\nIt was logical, maybe, to think that way, but completely off base. There were no drugs. Just a boy targeted by a killer, who was bent on jihad.\nThe killer, according to the court documents, says that Tevlin\u2019s death was \"a just kill.\u201d An act of vengeance and retaliation for U.S military action in the Middle East. \u201cAll these lives are taken every single day by America, by this government. So a life for a life\u201d said the devout Muslim.\nSo that\u2019s what the police meant when they said he was \u201ctargeted.\u201d It would have been helpful if they\u2019d clarified that a bit. Instead of adding insult to the profound injury already inflicted on Brendan\u2019s family and friends.\nThe use of the word \u201ctargeted\u201d led me, and others, to conclude that in some way Brendan had put himself in danger and that although his death was tragic, it couldn\u2019t happen to my child (or your child) if they didn\u2019t do the same thing.\nBut that odd comfort and conclusion were sadly mistaken.\nBrendan could be my son, or yours. His only crime? Being in the wrong place at the wrong time, targeted by a person terrorizing a community and exacting revenge.\nBrendan\u2019s killing belongs in the category of the Fort Hood shootings by Maj. Nidal Hassan or the drive by shooting of a storefront military recruiter in Little Rock in 2009. These were both random acts of terrorism, on our soil.\nBut that\u2019s not what Brendan\u2019s family wants you to know. They want you to remember their son. The handsome, young man who played the bag pipes and loved music. The talented student and gregarious guy, who won over friends and professors in his first year at the University of Richmond. The Seton Hall Prep graduate and lacrosse player who went on to play on his club college team.\nAll the promise that was cut short. He had his whole life ahead of him until this low-life murderer decided to rob him and his family of all that.\nI\u2019m sorry if I sound too angry or impartial. But every time I look at this young man, I think, he could have been my son. My heart breaks for his mom and dad and his sister and brothers.\nThe country stopped this summer as we watched the hurt and anger in Ferguson after Michael Brown\u2019s body lay on the ground for hours after he was shot and killed by law enforcement. The pundits and preachers flocked to Ferguson, outraged at what the police had done. Protestors filled the streets and riots broke out. It was a terrible story.\nSo where is our collective outrage and remembrance of Brendan Tevlin? His story has been lost in a sorry media double standard.", "\nPlenty of Republicans remain bitter that their party passed that bloated $1.3 trillion omnibus\u2014almost as bitter as President Trump, who felt pressured to sign it. But this fight doesn\u2019t have to be over.\nAcross Washington, principled conservatives are noodling with an idea that\u2014if done right\u2014could be a political winner. It\u2019s a chance for Republicans to honor their promises of spending restraint and redeem themselves with a base turned off by the omnibus blowout. It\u2019s an opening for the GOP to highlight the degree to which Democrats used the bill to hold the military hostage to their own domestic boondoggles. And it\u2019s a chance for Mr. Trump to present himself again as an outsider, willing to use unconventional means to change Washington\u2019s spending culture.\nIt\u2019s called the 1974 Impoundment Act, which allows the president to order the rescission of specific funds, so long as Congress approves those cuts within 45 days. The act hasn\u2019t seen a lot of use in recent decades. Barack Obama never saw a spending bill he didn\u2019t like, and George W. Bush never sent any formal rescission proposals to Congress\u2014likely because he took the position that presidents ought to have a fuller line-item veto power. Many conservatives agree, though Ronald Reagan used rescission where he could and holds the title for most proposals. Even so, the total amount all presidents since 1974 have put forward for rescission ($76 billion) and the amount Congress ultimately approved ($25 billion) remains pathetic.\nRepublicans could change that. Their control of the White House and both chambers gives them an unusual opportunity to cut big. Under the Impoundment Act, a simple majority is enough to approve presidential rescissions\u2014no filibuster. It\u2019s a chance to take a hacksaw to the $128 billion by which the omnibus exceeded the 2011 domestic-spending caps\u2014everything from carbon-capture technology to pecan producers to the Gateway Tunnel Project to the Environmental Protection Agency.", "\nTammy Bruce: Poor California -- Democrats are turning the state into a major nightmare\nPoor California.

Orange County, the third-largest county in the country, is joining the federal lawsuit against the sanctuary law.\nUPI reported: \u201cThe 4-0 vote from the Republican-controlled Orange County Board of Supervisors follows actions by other Orange County leaders to resist SB 54. Earlier this month, the city council of Los Alamitos voted to \u2018opt-out\u2019 of the law and this week, Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens decided to put release dates of county jail inmates online to the public, which allows ICE officials to get that information without having to go directly through local law enforcement.\u201d\nLo and behold, in the face of this rejection of the absurd, California officials suddenly issued \u201cnew guidance\u201d on what state and local law enforcement are \u201callowed\u201d to do, including sharing information about criminal illegal immigrants with the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE.\nThe state also deigned to permit California law enforcement officers to \u201cassist any law enforcement official, even if those officials are engaged in immigration enforcement, but only when the California law enforcement officer is enforcing state law.\u2026\u201d How nice.\nIf the chaos surrounding the protection of criminal illegal immigrants wasn\u2019t enough, Californians are dealing with the results of Proposition 47, which was passed by the voters in 2014. Californians were told the measure would allow them to put fewer people in jail and save the state tens of millions of dollars, which could be invested in diversion programs. In other words, the state decriminalized certain drug and property crimes.\nInstead of rainbows and unicorns, what actually happened was a disaster.\n\u201cProposition 47 downgraded a variety of \u2018non-serious, nonviolent crimes\u2019 that had previously been considered felonies to misdemeanors\u2026. A thief may now steal something under (a $950 limit) on a daily basis and it will never rise to felony status.\u2026 In the event that a perpetrator is pursued and apprehended, the consequence can be a small fine or a brief stay in jail.

He juxtaposed that speedy ban with the situation in the U.S. where \u201ca minority with strong views can thwart even popular legislation, supported by hard evidence.\u201d\nHe added:\nA recent RAND survey pointed out that policies and laws that could bring about a drop in gun deaths as small as just 1 percent here in the U.S. would translate to 1,500 fewer deaths in a decade. Making gun trafficking a federal crime would save lives in cities like Chicago, where the majority of guns confiscated in crimes are purchased legally out of state and make their way into the city, which has zero gun shops.\nClinton continued:\nThe truth is, when we are able to pass sensible gun laws, they work. The Brady Bill and the background checks initiated through its implementation have prevented millions of gun sales to people who shouldn\u2019t own one. Today, the nation\u2019s gun homicide rate is one-third lower than when I signed the Brady Bill into law in 1993.\nMissing from Clinton\u2019s observations is the fact that Illinois has universal background checks, gun owner licensing, and other strict controls, yet criminals are not fazed by them. Moreover, ATF form 4473\u2013the background check form\u2013asks gun purchasers to affirm that they are buying their gun for themselves rather than buying it to pass to someone else, but criminals are unfazed by this as well.\nAnother important thing missing from Clinton\u2019s background checks is the fact that they have failed to stop every school shooting that occurred between 1998 and now, including Columbine. Moreover, Clinton\u2019s background checks have proven to be the preferred way by which mass shooters in this century have acquired their guns.", "\nDonald Trump Thunders at Media for Trying to Smear His Supporters after Bomb Scares\nAP Photo/Chuck Burton26 Oct 2018\nPresident Donald Trump denounced the media on Friday for trying to pin the recent bomb scare on him and his supporters.\n\u201cWe have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican party,\u201d Trump said.\nThe president commented on the news at his rally in Charlotte, North Carolina after authorities apprehended the Florida man suspected of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats.\nTrump condemned political violence and called for an end to the politics of personal destruction, especially from the media.\n\u201cPolitical violence must never ever be allowed in America and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to stop it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe media has a major role to play, whether they want to or not.\u201d\nThe president paused as his supporters continued to chant \u201cCNN SUCKS!\u201d\n\u201cThey have a major role to play as far as tone, as far as everything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe media\u2019s constant unfair coverage, deep hostility, and negative attacks only serve to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate.\u201d\nTrump recalled that Republicans did not use the aftermath of the Steve Scalise shooting by a left-wing radical to score political points.\n\u201cWe did not use that heinous attempt at mass murder for political gain, because that would have been the wrong thing to do,\u201d he said.\nTrump was fiercely defensive of his supporters, reminding them of the media\u2019s tone against them.\n\u201cThe media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement to give power back to the people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur supporters are some of the most honest, wonderful, principled, hard working, patriotic people on the face of God\u2019s earth.\u201d", "\nOn September 16, Kavanaugh and his loved ones were dropped into a pit of hell due to allegations of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford. Although her story quickly fell apart during public testimony, for the three-plus weeks that would follow, in an effort to derail his confirmation, Democrats and their allies in the establishment media did everything in their power to personally destroy this man as a drunken serial rapist.\nNBC News and Avenatti played a huge role in this obscene smear campaign. One notable example was NBC breathlessly publishing and airing an assault allegation against Kavanaugh that was quickly exposed as a hoax. NBC did not even bother to independently corroborate this allegation prior to airing it. A Democrat handed NBC the smear, and NBC ran with it.\nTo make matters worse, we now know NBC News withheld crucial information that undermined the allegations made by Swetnick, the Avenatti client who accused a high school-aged Kavanaugh of spiking punch bowls at house parties so he and his buddies could engage in serial rapes.\nAnd we know NBC deliberately withheld this crucial information because NBC is now admitting it had this information all the way back on September 30.\nOn September 30, a week prior to Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, during the most intense days of this scandal, when Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was still very much in doubt, here is what NBC did not want the public to know\u2026\nIf you recall, although he withheld the name, Avenatti tweeted out a sworn statement from a woman who backed up Swetnick\u2019s outrageous rape allegations. In her statement, this second woman swore that she, too, had witnessed Kavanaugh spike punch bowls and take sexual advantage of girls.\nWell, unbeknownst to us, NBC interviewed this anonymous witness on September 30, and she recanted!\nReferring to Kavanaugh spiking the punch, \u201cI didn\u2019t ever think it was Brett,\u201d the woman said to reporters in a phone interview arranged by Avenatti on Sept. 30 after repeated requests to speak with other witnesses who might corroborate Swetnick\u2019s claims.\n\u2026\nWhen asked in the phone interview if she ever witnessed Kavanaugh act inappropriately towards girls, the woman replied, \u201cno.\u201d\nWait, it gets worse\u2026\nOn October 3, NBC News again spoke to this woman, and this time, she all but accused Avenatti of fabricating her statement:\n[R]eached by phone independently from Avenatti on Oct. 3, the woman said she only \u201cskimmed\u201d the declaration. After reviewing the statement, she wrote in a text on Oct. 4 to NBC News: \u201cIt is incorrect that I saw Brett spike the punch. I didn\u2019t see anyone spike the punch\u2026I was very clear with Michael Avenatti from day one.\u201d\nWhen pressed about abusive behavior towards girls, she wrote in a text: \u201cI would not ever allow anyone to be abusive in my presence. Male or female.\u201d\nAnd now, we come to the grand conclusion\u2026\nWhen asked about the total contradiction between his client\u2019s sworn statement and what she told NBC, after it no longer matters, NBC now informs us, \u201cAt one point, in an apparent effort to thwart the reporting process, [Avenatti] added in the phone call, \u201cHow about this, on background, it\u2019s not the same woman. What are you going to do with that?\u201d\nMoreover, NBC News believed Kavanaugh\u2019s chief tormentor \u2014 Avenatti \u2014 was attempting to \u201cthwart the reporting process,\u201d and NBC also chose to hide this information until long after it mattered.\nSo what we have here is an NBC News eager to publish completely unfounded allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh while at the same time hiding vitally important information that would have helped to clear Kavanaugh at the most crucial time of this scandal.\nIn other words, in a partisan effort to derail Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, to do its part to keep Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court, NBC News published uncorroborated smears against him and then engaged in a deliberate cover up of a legitimate story that backed up Kavanaugh\u2019s claim of his innocence and his claim that there was a coordinated campaign at work to personally destroy him.", "\nPresident Donald Trump griped about the media focusing on the bomb scares targeted at prominent Democrats on Friday, suggesting it was hurting Republican chances in the midterms.\n\u201cRepublicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this \u2018Bomb\u2019 stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows.\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\nNews coverage of the suspicious packages sent to prominent Trump critics continued to dominate as authorities discovered additional packages addressed to Sen.

Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), Rep. Mark Meadows(R-N.C.), and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) have warned about for months \u2013 that the FBI used an unverified dossier, paid for by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party as political opposition research, to justify spying on the duly nominated GOP candidate for president just weeks before Election Day.\nThe original FISA warrant application submitted in October 2016, along with the three 90-day renewal, were labeled \u201cVerified application. \u201cThe FBI has reviewed this verified application for accuracy in accordance with its April 5, 2001 procedures, which include sending a copy of the draft to the appropriate field office(s),\u201d the applications read.\nAlong with being unaware of the dossier\u2019s veracity, Comey did not know that Bruce Ohr, the Justice Department\u2019s fourth-highest ranking official before his demotion last year, was a go-between for collecting so-called intelligence from Steele after the FBI terminated its relationship with the agent for allegedly leaking information to the media. Further, Solomon reports that Comey could not recall that Steele\u2019s relationship with the bureau had even been terminated.\n\u201cHis memory was so bad I feared he might not remember how to get out of the room after the interview,\u201d an unnamed congressman told Solomon. \u201cIt was like he suddenly developed dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, after conveniently remembering enough facts to sell his book,\u201d said another.\nNot only did Comey claim repeatedly he was unaware of key details concerning Steele and the dossier, but was \u201cinstructed\u201d by his lawyers, including one who belonged to the Justice Department, to answer questions regarding the two hot button matters, along with FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information.\n\u201cOne of the disappointments of this deposition so far has been the amount of times in which the FBI believes that Congress doesn\u2019t have a right to know,\u201d Rep.

For this reason, the EU\u2019s negotiators are in no hurry to offer Theresa May any kind of improvement on their current deal offer: they think she\u2019s stuck with it regardless.\nLabour is content largely to watch while the Tory party destroys itself.

They don\u2019t want to push for a second referendum themselves because they fear a backlash from their working class Brexit-supporting voters. However, while they will not initiate a second referendum, their shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has argued they should support one if it comes along.\nIt\u2019s becoming increasingly clear, isn\u2019t it, that all the events leading up to Brexit referendum vote in June 2016 were completely irrelevant. Worse, the victory won by the 17.4 million people who voted Brexit, was an illusory triumph.

Yet that hasn\u2019t stopped the media from passing it off as fact, right?\nThe FBI received the first installment of the dossier in July 2016. It received later installments as they were written at the height of the presidential campaign, which means the bureau has had more than a year to investigate the allegations in the document. The dossier was financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign and compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.\nAn August 24, 2017 subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee to the FBI and Justice Department asked for information on the bureau\u2019s efforts to validate the dossier. Specifically, the subpoena demanded \u201cany documents, if they exist, that memorialize DOJ and/or FBI efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate information provided by Mr. Steele and/or sub-sources and/or contained in the \u2018Trump Dossier.'\u201d\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, neither the FBI nor the Justice Department has provided documents in response to that part of the committee\u2019s subpoena. But in face-to-face briefings with congressional staff, according to those sources, FBI and DOJ officials have said they cannot verify the dossier\u2019s charges of a conspiracy between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.\nThe news appears to contradict recent statements from some top Democrats. \u201cA lot of it has turned out to be true,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence panel, told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe biggest thing that I think people need to realize about the dossier is that Christopher Steele discovered that the Russians were embarked on a broad effort to help the Trump campaign before our own intelligence agencies came to the same conclusion,\u201d Schiff told the Journal. \u201cIn the broadest outline of what he investigated, he proved more than prescience \u2014 he proved accurate in terms of the Russian involvement and what their motivations were.\u201d\nWhatever the case, the bottom line appears to be that the FBI and the Justice Department are not vouching for the accuracy of the substantive allegations of collusion in the dossier. Indeed, a careful reading of Schiff\u2019s interview with the Wall Street Journal suggests even the combative top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee isn\u2019t doing so, either.\nSo the question remains, why in the world would the media be so careless as to use this dossier as a source of information, knowing full well the allegations contained within have not been verified in any way?\nBecause they hate Trump so bad they\u2019re willing to completely abandon what few moral principles they possess, all two of them, in order to oppose him and take down his administration.\nThe media, which is supposed to help hold people accountable and provide the public with the truth, is totally cool with lying so long as it helps them push the agenda they want to see implemented in America.\nJoin the Discussion\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, vulgarity, profanity, all caps, or discourteous behavior.

The Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand luxury hotels, all in the capital, were also targeted.\nThe carnage is almost beyond words.\nSt Sebastian\u2019s church in Negombo was severely damaged in one explosion, with dozens killed at the site. Images from inside showed blood on the pews and the building\u2019s ceiling shattered.\nThere were also heavy casualties at the site of the first blast in St Anthony\u2019s, a hugely popular shrine in Kochchikade, a district of Colombo.\nWhilst many of those slaughtered were Sri Lankan nationals, many other Nationalities are amongst the dead.\nAt least five British people \u2013 including two with joint US citizenship \u2013 are believed to be among the dead. The US State Department says \u201cseveral\u201d Americans have been killed. Three Danish citizens and two Turkish nationals were also killed, their governments have confirmed. Netherlands Foreign Minister Stef Blok said in a statement that one Dutch national has also died. Reports say three Indian nationals and one Portuguese citizen have also been killed, with more foreign nationals still to be identified.\nThe media seem curiously reluctant to name the culprits. Which group, we wonder, might single out this gathering of Christians for intended carnage? What sort of people HATE Christians with such maniacal and murderous intent?\nIt is reported in Sri Lanka that the terrorist behind at least one of the bombings was an Islamist Extremist Imam and preacher by the name of Moulvi Zahran Hashim\nHashim has been active on Youtube pushing hatred and intolerance and yet for some reason, whilst Youtube bans Tommy Robinson, it did not ban Hashim.\nAnother of the terrorists was identified as Abu Mohammed.\nIt is further reported that the problem of the Islamic State has been rampant in Sri Lanka since 2016. Back then, the Sri Lankan Parliament was told that 32 Muslims from elite families had joined ISIS. The following year, scores of Sri Lankan ISIS terrorists returned from Syria, following which there was a spike in Jihadi activity. This appears to have culminated in today\u2019s atrocities. This was Jihad.\nFurther details will emerge in the time ahead but the fact is that militant Muslims chose this, the most sacred day in the Christian calendar, to slaughter Christian worshippers. Had this been the slaughter of Muslims in Mosques by Christians, the media and political class would have ablaze with fury and judgement. Yet today the same media and political class instinctively shy away from asking tough questions concerning why these Muslims want to kill Christians. The hypocrisy is almost as deafening as the killings have been barbaric.\nThere is no excuse for terrorism from any source. Killing innocent people as they go about their worship is obscene. Just as the killing of 50 Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, was utterly repugnant, so is this mass co-ordinated slaughter in Sri Lanka. The difference, of course, is that the former was the result of one deranged individual whereas what we witness in Sri Lanka today are multiple attacks carried out by a global radical Islamist group\nYou cannot defeat the enemy unless you name it. That name is Radical Islam.\nDavid Vance used to be disgusted but now he tries to be amused!

Islam? No, i wont allow anyone claiming under the name of Islam to kill mercilessly, sadistic in nature\u2026 ISIS is just that, extreemist, terorist.. Name of islam they put is camouflage of their extreem sadistic behaviour\u2026\nProphet Muhammad, peace be upon him, once said, at the end of time there will be people claiming they have faith (islam) but actually his faith is being thrown like arrow out of the bow (out fast, very far)\u2026 indeed in this trying time you should not labelling un-appropriately, it only create cycle pf hatred towards innocent people", "\nCLIMATE CHANGE; OR \u2018THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS\u2019.\nShare\nInterested yet appalled observers have watched in total disbelief as Australian Governments, through their cack-handed \u2018Climate- Change-and pay-for-weather-to-change\u2019 policies have virtually destroyed; through incompetence, venality, belief in discredited theories about the Climate, and a total lack of political competence; a well-designed, well-managed, cheap and functional electricity distribution system. Replacing it with a set of policies which have doomed the Australian public to decades of brown- and black-outs due to a reliance on electricity generation from solar panels, wind turbines and (believe it or not) super-Carbon-Dioxide-generators powered by diesel engines as main base load generators at what can be categorically stated as the most costly electricity prices on the planet.\nFor years, Australian power generation policies have rested upon a base load supply generated by coal-fired and gas-turbine powered generating stations, supplemented by hydro power schemes. Result, a power generation system designed and controlled by Engineers, which delivered electricity cheaply over the vast expanses of the external rim of the Australian Continent. For those who perhaps do not understand how big Australia really is, check out the fact that from Perth to Sydney is 2,700 miles. Through the lunatic policies such as the Renewables Energy Target, the Australian Government, after the forced closure of the Hazelwood coal-burning generation station, allowed AGL, the owners of both Bayswater and Liddell coal-fired power stations to increase their prices for electricity. The Liddell plant was repriced from $40 to $60 per megawatt hour, to greater than $5,000 per megawatt hour, making almost $3 billions extra profit for the Generation giant during the recent power surge. This profit was also boosted by much of the power offered by the Bayswater plant almost doubling in price, from about $40 per megawatt hour, to about $80 per megawatt hour.\nWho, readers may well, ask, is paying for this absurd rise in a Generator company\u2019s profits? Well, just as ever, it is the poor, silent Aussie taxpayers who foot that bill, as well as every other attempt at making \u2018Climate-Change-and pay-for-weather-to-change\u2019 policies actually work. But the real reason why the electricity bills for the average Aussie has quadrupled in four years is through the change in the unreal expectations of the Network Owners. Here\u2019s what consumers are paying for: in 2010, the networks began to spend $45 billion, approved by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), on building and upgrading the poles and wires. This unprecedented spending allowance was granted on the back of dire warnings from the networks that energy demand was about to skyrocket, and unless the networks were allowed to spend tens of billions, the poles and wires simply wouldn\u2019t cope.\nUnfortunately, the networks did not realise that Electricity generation was changing, and this vast upgrade, built to give a system which could withstand upheavals, missed the revolution indicated by solar and battery technology\nHere\u2019s what consumers are paying for: in 2010, the networks began to spend $45 billion, approved by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), on building and upgrading the poles and wires. This unprecedented spending allowance was granted on the back of dire warnings from the networks that energy demand was about to skyrocket, and unless the networks were allowed to spend tens of billions, the poles and wires simply wouldn\u2019t cope.\nHere\u2019s the rub: the networks had a strong incentive to ignore the naysayers, because the more they built, the more they got paid.\nDespite year-on-year reductions in demand, the networks carried on building to match their over-inflated projections, installing Rolls Royce infrastructure that consumers hadn\u2019t asked for, and would never need. Eventually, when the evidence was too pressing to ignore, the networks did rein in some of their spending, but not enough to stop electricity bills going through the roof.\nBefore the networks even had their spending approved, industry observers and experts were warning them \u2013 and the regulator \u2013 that their demand projections were way too high, and would lead to unnecessary investment.\n\u201cThere were signs. Many organisations and individuals \u2013 and I was one of them \u2013 said their demand forecast was simply too high,\u201d says analyst Bruce Mountain, who\u2019s been advising regulators around the world for almost 25 years.\n\u201cBut I think also one needs to ask the question: have they profited from an expansion of their capacity? Was this something from which they stood to gain? The answer is obviously yes. They stood to gain very sizeably.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the rub: the networks had a strong incentive to ignore the naysayers, because the more they built, the more they got paid. Not only could they charge every dollar of that $45 billion back to consumers through their bills; they could also add on another 10 per cent \u2013 their \u201cregulated rate of return\u201d \u2013 and charge that back to consumers as well.\nThis incentive was supercharged in 2006 by state governments: they wrote the rules for the regulator to enforce, thanks to a deal with former prime minister John Howard, who gave them rulemaking authority in exchange for their blessing to replace state-based regulators with one new federal body.\nThe most egregious overspending on the poles and wires occurred in NSW and Queensland, where the networks are government-owned. This also happens to be where network profits have risen the fastest, via the bills of businesses and households across both states.\nFor the foreseeable future, consumers will continue to pay for investment they didn\u2019t ask for, and will never need, every time they pay their electricity bills.\nBruce Mountain has conducted detailed analysis of network profits in these two states. According to his calculations, in 2008 \u2013 prior to their multi-billion dollar spending spree \u2013 the profit they earned on every electricity connection (every house or business connected to the grid) was $180. Today, it\u2019s $500.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen network charges higher in any other region or country of the world,\u201d says Mountain.\nMuch of this profit was generated by a neat trick: back in 2010, using a combination of lobbying and legal appeals, the networks secured a 10 per cent interest rate on their cost of borrowing. This was several percentage points higher than they had to pay their lenders, especially in NSW and Queensland, where the networks borrowed at low government interest rates. But no matter what rate the networks actually had to pay, consumers were charged the full 10 per cent.\nCalculated on billions of dollars, every percentage point the networks could secure above the actual interest rate they paid equated to hundreds of millions \u2013 all of it pure profit, and all of it paid for by consumers through their electricity bills.\nThis is all perfectly permissible, according to the networks\u2019 peak body, the Energy Networks Association. Every dollar of network spending has been assessed and approved by the Australian Energy Regulator \u2013 it\u2019s not the networks\u2019 fault if that decision was too excessive. Besides, if the networks were to be forced to return some of their profits, that would create an unstable \u2013 and untenable \u2013 investment environment that would end up costing consumers more in the long run.\nBut even the regulator has conceded the network price increases are \u201chard to justify\u201d. In its 2011 State of the Energy Market Report, the AER said it was restricted from making \u201cholistic assessments\u201d of how much of the investment was efficient or necessary, and that \u201cthis restriction has led to consumers paying more than necessary for a safe and reliable energy supply\u201d\nYes, the networks needed to upgrade their poles, cables, substations and other transmission equipment, but it is the average poor bloody Aussie who cannot afford to buy the solar panels and the storage batteries which can take advantage of Australia\u2019s bountiful sunshine, and who are tied to the networks cables for their electricity.\nBut readers must turn, reluctantly, from the stark lack of choice imposed upon Australian energy users to the equally stark choices being forced upon us here in Great Britain & Northern Ireland (GB&NI). After the grovelling morons (MPs) in Westminster voted in the Climate Change Act, we in GB&NI have watched as the Climate Change clowns have steered us towards an Energy collapse; by starving coal power stations of maintenance funding because they do not comply with EU Regs; by vast amounts of subsidy (your taxpayer cash) flooding into the holy \u2018Renewables\u2019 cashbag (wind turbines, solar, and by burning wood(Yes, Wood) at Drax Power station): as well as by not building replacement power stations to replace the old nuclear stations as they approach the end of their safe working lives! We also watch the un-dead hands of the greedy thieving culprits as they use the pretence of pushing \u2018Climate Change\u2019, and the billions of \u00a3 sterling therein, towards enriching themselves at the public expense. For instance Lord Deben, a.k.a. the former MP John Selwyn Gummer is alleged to have enriched his family company by up to \u00a3600,000.00 by facilitating contracts for those companies who have made substantial payments to his family company. In speech after speech, the QUANGO which he chairs has pushed the acceptance of battery-powered cars to the point where his Committee is advising the Government to push for all petrol- and diesel-powered cars to be banned by A.D. 2030 rather than A.D. 2040. He makes no mention of the fact that Johnson Matthey, who paid his company nearly \u00a3300,000.00, is planning to build a huge vehicle battery plant somewhere in GB&NI.\nBut nowhere in this huge pile of lying garbage spun out by this same Climate Change Committee is given the slightest hint of the sheer problems which will be unearthed once the demand for charging all these \u201cCarbon-Neutral\u2019 battery powered cars becomes evident. We will need the present number of power stations which give a coherent, stable base load to be increased by a factor of 200%. The reasons for this huge increase in power availability is not only through the need to power the millions of battery charge points to give battery-powered vehicles the stable source needed; but also to also absorb the huge increase in generation load once the ban comes into force whereby all gas-fired boilers will be removed, BY LAW, and replaced with electricity-powered heating systems. This last statement is not envisaged as yet, but as the same Committee is pushing for all new homes to be fitted with electric boilers, (so as not to add to the \u201cCarbon Dioxide\u201d emissions, so denigrated by the Climate and Greenie-brigades: it will not be far behind, as the dreaded \u201cCarbon-Dioxide fuelled Climate Change\u201d is just around the corner. Also not included is the vast expense of installing suitable electrical connections for the aforementioned electric boilers, and the slightly secondary problem of where all these skilled electricians, necessary for the electrical boiler and electric stoves to be fitted: are going to be found, trained, paid and overseen!\nAlso unforeseen, but would be self-evident, is the total upgrade of the National Grid, together with all the towers, overhead cabling, switchyards, massive transformers and associated switchgear; as the present system is just managing.\nThe final item, forgotten by all except those, who like me, think things through to the end: is \u2018who is gonna\u2019 pay for all these things? The new electrical boilers, the stoves, the switchgear, the towers, the cabling, the skilled staff to install and run the very upgrades, the new power stations: they don\u2019t come cheap. As ever, its you and I, the bloody taxpayers, who will be forced to foot the bill financing this fools\u2019 paradise!", "\nFAR LEFT \u201cTHUG\u201d IS PROMINENT LABOUR PARTY MEMBER\nShare\nA ringleader of an angry far-left mob that shut down a Parliamentary hustings in south east London due to \u201cpublic safety fears\u201d is a prominent member of the Labour Party, AltNewsMedia can exclusively reveal today.\nOn Tuesday 12th June, just 48 hours before the Lewisham East by-election, up to 50 hard-left activists descended on a venue in Catford and barricaded the entrance in protest at For Britain Movement leader Anne Marie Waters speaking at the debate. UKIP candidate David Kurten was also abused inside and outside the hustings and video evidence shows members of the public being spat at and attacked with placards by the agitators before police pulled the plug on the event.\nIn one of the most shocking scenes from the evening, Kurten\u2019s YouTube channel captures a man jostling with people at the entrance to the Salvation Army whilst chanting \u201cRacist scum! Racist scum!\u201d. When a member of the public tries to push his way through the melee to make the start of the debate, the man screeches \u201cShame on you! Shame on you!\u201d repeatedly and with such intensity that at one point his voice audibly breaks.\nAs the innocent bystander squeezes past two police officers, the man leans his head to within centimetres of him and screams \u201cShame on you, you fucking mug!\u201d. As this happens, one police officer raises his finger at the man whilst the other pushes him away to prevent a potential violent, and seemingly unprovoked, flashpoint.\nOne community leader was passing at the time of the incident and was so shocked by his actions that having watched it back online afterwards, decided to come forward and pass AltNewsMedia information about his identity. He says the man undoubtedly played an instrumental role in police deciding to cancel the event on safety grounds.\nToday we can reveal that the aggressive and abusive far-left agitator held back by police as a member of the public tried to get inside the building is 26-year-old William Miles, a Labour Party youth officer in the Perry Vale branch for Lewisham West & Penge. He is also one of two admins on the Lewisham West and Penge CLP Young Labour Group\u2019s closed Facebook page and in April he also became joint campaigns officer for Lewisham Momentum.\nMiles is admin of his local Labour\u2019s groups closed Facebook page\nThe proud \u201ccomrade\u201d, who studied English & Creative Writing at the University of Greenwich but now lists himself as unemployed on his own blogsite, is pictured recently with several high-profile Labour Party figures including MP Laura Pidcott and Guardian columnist Owen Jones. AltNewsMedia\u2019s investigation shows that Miles was a key campaigner for one of Labour\u2019s candidates in the by-election, Momentum-backed Sakina Sheikh, who herself has been mired in controversy after Guido Fawkesrevealed she had recently shared a platform with radical Imam Shakeel Begg. In 2016 the High Court ruled the extremist preacher from Lewisham Islamic Centre had \u201cclearly promoted and encouraged violence in support of Islam and espoused a series of extremist Islamic positions.\u201d\nMiles in another photo tweeted by Sheikh during her recent campaigning\nPrevious social media posts display Miles\u2019 thuggish tendencies, listing a new year\u2019s resolution to \u201cBring down the government. Stay with the trouble\u201d and in September 2017 posting \u201cPacifist here, desperate for a fight\u201d. When Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States he tweeted that \u201ca struggle is at hand of a scale we haven\u2019t had in generations\u201d before adding \u201cNo excuses now, history is alive.\u201d\nOne of Miles\u2019 tweets from September last year\nAnd another published at the start of 2018\nJanet Daby, Labour\u2019s eventual by-election winner and now new Lewisham East MP, refused to attend the hustings saying she was reluctant to give Waters the \u201coxygen of publicity\u201d. But while Daby was absent, leaflets handed out by hard-left agitators boasted support from Lewisham West & Penge Labour Party as well as Lewisham TUC and Lewisham NEU.\nThe local man, who has asked AltNewsMedia to keep his identity hidden for fear of reprisals, told us: \u201cI believe in a fair, democratic process and was outraged by the actions of some of the Lewisham Labour members. William Miles, obviously a paid-up member of the Labour Party, is clearly seen abusing those trying to enter the hustings through thuggery and inhibiting other people\u2019s rights to participate in the democratic process.\n\u201cIt is so sad they prevented, through violence and intimidation, political parties from across the spectrum presenting their policies and having them challenged. I find it hugely hypocritical that an active member of the Labour Party, who is involved in assisting his party\u2019s candidates, would prevent other parties and candidates from doing the same. This clearly goes against the fundamental principles of a free and fair election.\u201d\nMiles pictured with MP Laura Pidcock\nIt appears Miles also has links with the violent AntiFa organisation, \u2018liking\u2019 a London Antifascists page on Facebook and appearing in a video from May 2017 entitled \u201cDefend Croydon\u201d where he is pictured alongside masked men holding black anarchist flags and getting into several confrontations with the police.\nAltNewsMedia contacted Miles, MP Daby and Labour Party HQ about the revelations but none of them had responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.\nTo read the initial story deconstructing the media bias over the Lewisham East hustings, visit this page.", "\nTAOS, N.M., April 22 (Reuters) - The leader of an armed group that is stopping undocumented migrants crossing into the United States from Mexico is expected in court on Monday as federal prosecutors crack down on civilians attempting to enforce immigration policy.\nThe FBI on Saturday arrested Larry Hopkins, leader of the United Constitutional Patriots group, whose camouflage-wearing armed members claim to have helped U.S. officials detain some 5,600 migrants in the last two months.\nThe group claims to be working in support of President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration. Last week it drew the criticism of New Mexico's Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and the American Civil Liberties Union, which accused it of illegally detaining migrants.\nHopkins, a 69-year-old who also goes by the name Johnny Horton, was arrested in Sunland Park, New Mexico, on a federal complaint charging him with being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.\nHe is expected to appear in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, at 10:30 a.m. local time (1630 GMT).\nThe group he leads, the UCP, describes itself as a \"patriot group\" helping U.S. Customs and Border Patrol cope with record numbers of Central American families crossing the border to seek asylum. It has had around half a dozen members camped out on a rotating basis near Sunland Park since late February.\nVideos posted online by the UCP show members telling migrants to stop, sit down and wait for agents to arrive. Critics accuse the UCP of impersonating law enforcement.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a weekend statement that it did not support citizens taking law enforcement into their own hands, and instead encouraged them to report suspicious activity to officials.\n\"The rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes,\" New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas said in a statement.\nHopkins was previously arrested in Oregon in 2006 on suspicion of impersonating a police officer and being a felon in possession of a firearm, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nBenvie described the UCP as mostly made up of military veterans who he said carry firearms for self defense. He denied that members of the group had pointed weapons at migrants.

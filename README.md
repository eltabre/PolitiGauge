# PolitiGauge
Trying to find bias in the way people write to keep readers informed of what bias the author potentially holds


## File Hierarchy
This project is broken up into many different files that serve different purposes.

### Notebooks
The notebook folder is where we do most of the data exploration for the different parts of this project. You will find three different distinct parts:

1. The IBC exploration with the RNNs that we were trying out
2. The Convote/Social-Media/Article exploration that found linguistic features that were significant
3. Organizational exploration, most of this folder shows how we scraped allsides and mediabiasfactcheck to get their bias ratings for organizations.

### Extension
This folder houses the extension, requirements are flask and justext. We will try to put this on the chrome store so that it can be downloaded whenever.

### Graphs
Just a folder with a bunch of pictures


### scripts

This is an empty folder, we will probably fill it later


## Using data
In this repo we ignore uploading all of the data into a data folder so in order to run the code data must be added and some of the code must be modified.
